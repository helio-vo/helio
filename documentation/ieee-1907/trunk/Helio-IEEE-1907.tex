\section{An e-Science infrastructure for heliophysics}
Heliophysics is the study of the effects of the Sun on the Solar
System; it addresses problems that span a number of existing
disciplines â€“ solar and heliospheric physics, and magnetospheric and
ionospheric physics for the Earth and other planets. The discipline is
closely related to the study of Space Weather, which can affect the
technology on which we all depend, however heliophysics is more
generalised covering all parts of the Solar System rather than just
the Sun-Earth connection.

In order to undertake a search for things that are scientifically
interesting in heliophysics, we need to understand the origins of
phenomena and how they propagate through interplanetary space,
i.e. the path they follow and the time scales involved. This requires
the ability to track things in 4-dimensions, which is a key
difference from other astrophysical searches based on images of the 
``deep-sky'' which can use a two
dimensional coordinate system based on the celestial sphere (refs xx).

Virtual Observatories have been a highly successful approach to issues
of data sharing and re-use in astronomy (refs xx). However a Virtual
Observatory for Heliophysics needs extra tools to extend the
essentially two dimensional search space of deep sky
astronomy. Moreover the deep-sky astronomy community has developed
standards for data models and access methods that reduce the
complexity of the e-Infrastructure required for a VO. The communities
involved in heliophysics, hovever, have evolved independently over
decades and even centuries. Even though the links between the effects
observed in the domains are now evident, there have been virtually no
attempts to coordinate the way the communities conduct their data
analysis. As a consequence, there are considerable differences in the
way the communities store, describe and think about data.

In order to facilitate the study of this new discipline,
HELIO needs to address issues in a number of areas related
to two basic requirements, to:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Provide integrated access to data from all the domains
of heliophysics that are held in archives around the
world.
\item Provide the means to conduct searches across the
domains to identify data-sets of interest.
\end{itemize}

In (ref to AdSpSci paper) we described the scientific challenges involved.
In the present work we describe the e-Science infrastructure we are 
creating to meet these challenges. A major research problem is to 
search multiple catalogues or databases to track the development of 
event when the effects of events travel at different speeds. Heliophysics
events are first observed by observation of the sun and will then propagate
through the solar system to be observed by a variety of space and earth-based
instruments. Effects caused by photon emissions require line-of-sight
view of the source and any delays are related to exactly predictable light travel
times; those that are caused by particles occur with much
longer delays. These delays are not exactly predictable and in most cases the effects are only experience
if the propagating phenomena passes the observer.
 (see
Fig. 1).

 We utilise as much as possible previous work on VOs. However the dynamic nature of heliophysics means that we have had to borrow from Web Services approaches
used in biosciences. Thus we present a case-study of a fascinating cross-over
between e-Science techniques evolved from different disciplines but resulting
in a common approach to infrastructure building. In Section 2 we describe 
the architecture we have built. In Section 3 we describe how we meet the 
challenges of multiple data models and cross catalogue searches. In Section
4 we describe the scientific interface to the HELIO VO and show how it is 
utilised for a heliophysics query. In Section 5 we summarise the wider impact 
on e-Science and how our methods will respond to technology developments 
(e.g Cloud Computing)

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
