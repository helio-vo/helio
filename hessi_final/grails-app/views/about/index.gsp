		<h1>About HEDC</h1>
		<p>
			HEDC stands for RHESSI European Data Center. Its goal is to facilitate the exploration of the large amount of data products delivered by RHESSI. Raw RHESSI data are difficult to handle. Therefore, HEDC generates pre-processed products that can be used for browsing. In addition, HEDC stores all RHESSI observations online to support interactive data analysis.

			HEDC has originally been introduced by a team of researchers from Astronomy and Computer Science at ETH Zurich. It has been adapted to new technologies in 2009 by Computer Science students at the University of Applied Sciences North Western Switzerland (FHNW).  It is further maintained and developed there by the Institute of 4D Technologies.

			The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) was selected by NASA as a Small Explorer Mission in 1997. It was launched on February 5, 2002. The main goal of RHESSI is to understand energy release and acceleration processes in the solar corona, through observation of solar flares. The spacecraft has been built by the Space Sciences Laboratory of the University of California at Berkeley, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD, and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland. Scientific input and software has been contributed by ETH Zurich and FHNW in a collaboration between the Radio Astrophysics and Plasma Physics Group of the Institute of Astronomy, two computer science institutes: Information and Communication Systems Group and Laboratory for Software Technology, and the Institute of 4D Technology of FHNW.
