        <h1>Welcome to HEDC</h1>
        <p>HEDC (HESSI European Data Center) is a scientific data warehouse that is developed by a team of researchers from Astronomy and Computer Science at ETH Zurich. It aims at facilitating the use of HESSI data at ETH and worldwide. HESSI data products can easily be accessed, browsed and visualized. HEDC will store all HESSI observations online to support interactive data analysis. HEDC also serves as a base for research on the construction of scientific data warehouses. Topics of interest include: the structure of a scientific data warehouse (2-tier vs. 3-tier), support for external analysis systems (e.g, IDL), optimizations based on access patterns or alternative representations.</p>
