Notes: 
  Note that only events with non-zero position and energy range not equal to 3-6 keV are confirmed as solar sources.
  Events which have no position and show up mostly in the front detectors, but were not able to be imaged 
    are flagged as "PS".
  Events which do not have valid position are only confirmed to be non-solar if the NS flag is set.
  Peak Rate:  peak counts/second in energy range 6-12 keV, averaged over active collimators, including background.
  Total Counts:  counts in energy range 6-12 keV integrated over duration of flare summed over all subcollimators,
    including background.
  Energy:  the highest energy band in which the flare was observed.
  Radial Distance:  distance from Sun center
  Quality Codes: Qn, where n is the total number of data gap, SAA, particle, eclipse or decimation flags set for event.
    n ranges from 0 to 11.  Use care when analyzing the data when the quality is not zero.

Flare Flag Codes: 
  a0 - In attenuator state 0 (None) sometime during flare
  a1 - In attenuator state 1 (Thin) sometime during flare
  a2 - In attenuator state 2 (Thick) sometime during flare
  a3 - In attenuator state 3 (Both) sometime during flare
  An - Attenuator state (0=None, 1=Thin, 2=Thick, 3=Both) at peak of flare
  DF - Front segment counts were decimated sometime during flare
  DR - Rear segment counts were decimated sometime during flare
  ED - Spacecraft eclipse (night) sometime during flare
  EE - Flare ended in spacecraft eclipse (night)
  ES - Flare started in spacecraft eclipse (night)
  FE - Flare ongoing at end of file
  FR - In Fast Rate Mode
  FS - Flare ongoing at start of file
  GD - Data gap during flare
  GE - Flare ended in data gap
  GS - Flare started in data gap
  MR - Spacecraft in high-latitude zone during flare
  NS - Non-solar event
  PE - Particle event: Particles are present
  PS - Possible Solar Flare; in front detectors, but no position
  Pn - Position Quality: P0 = Position is NOT valid, P1 = Position is valid
  Qn - Data Quality: Q0 = Highest Quality, Q11 = Lowest Quality
  SD - Spacecraft was in SAA sometime during flare
  SE - Flare ended when spacecraft was in SAA
  SS - Flare started when spacecraft was in SAA
