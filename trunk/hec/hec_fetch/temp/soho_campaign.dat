444~Campaign~Filling Factors in Streamers~The objective is to diagnose the presence of electron density (N_e) inhomogeneities, along the line of sight, throughout the transition region (TR) and the corona.~Silvano Fineschi~In the extended corona, the diagnostics is based on comparing the intensity (I_c) of the collisional component of a coronal emission line [e.g., HI Lyman beta, 1025 Ang. (UVCS-OVI channel); FeXIV, 5303 Ang. (LASCO-C1)] to the polarized brightness (pB) of the visible K-corona (LASCO-C2 and UVCS-VL channel). The pB is proportional to <N_e>, while I_c to <N_e^2>. In the TR, CDS derives line emission measure (proportional to <N_e^2>) and observes density (i.e., <N_e>) sensitive chromospheric lines. The ratio <N_e^2>/<N_e>^2, that is, the filling factor, gives a diagnostics of the density inhomegeneities.~LASCO: Doug Biesecker; UVCS: Silvano Fineschi; CDS: Helen Mason~1996/09/26~1996/09/29~

The scope is to get, with the joint use of the several instruments, a detailed picture of the fast wind region, to study where and how the acceleration of the wind takes place.~Giovanni Peres~The EIT data of interest are those concentrating on the North Polar Coronal Hole and above it, during the week from 16 to 22 September 1996 and, in particular, the observations done for this purpose, on the 18 and the 21, from 16:00 to 20:00 UT. Repetead observations made with CDS and SUMER over the solar limb, at several times, and in the light of many lines whose temperature of maximum formation ranges from a few 10^4 K to 10^6 K, so as to cover the whole range of conditions. UVCS has spent more than 80 hours, the entire time not taken by the synoptic observations, during the week from 16 to 22 of september scanning the same polar coronal hole from 1.5 to 3.5 solar radii.

This objective has also evolved in the sense that we are also interested in the statistical properties of BPs (wrt micro-scale heating).~Jean-Claude Vial~This campaign has been run about 8 hours during the week, without EIT during week days (EIT bake out) and with EIT during week-end. MDI Hi-res modes have been used fully. For instance on 9 January, we hit a BP (SUMER and CDS) which corresponds to a dipole. Two feet can be distinguished in euv above the two polarities. EIT images indicate that we were lucky to catch at least two BPs on the central meridian. Pub.

1690~Campaign~MDI/LaPalma~Emerging flux, magnetic evolution, and x-ray bright point studies.~Julia Saba; Ted Tarbell~La Palma Observations - July 24 to August 4 For this observing run we intend to emphasize coordinated observations with SOHO. We plan to use three camera systems as follows: G band 3804 A - photosphere, shows small bright points associated with magnetic fields, cadence about 20s, fov about 80 x 120", 12 A wide filter K line 3934 - upper photosphere, chromosphere, cadence about 20s, fov about 120 x 140" 5250 magnetograms - photosphere, deep magnetograms, cadence about 1 minute, fov about 80 x 120" (H alpha observations may also be possible but not at the beginning of the run.) Images can be recorded continuously from about 8 UT to 18 UT. The high resolution (atmospheric conditions willing) and the high cadence make these observations very useful for emerging flux, magnetic evolution, and x-ray bright point studies when coordinated with the higher temperature regions that SOHO can observe. Generally we will want to point within the MDI high resolution field of view when MDI is in continuous contact and doing high resolution observations. Otherwise we intend to follow the SOHO target (as long as it is on the solar disk) for the current campaigns. Observations typically 8-12 UT, daily.~MDI; La Palma/SSO (GBO)~1997/07/23~1997/08/07~

For instance asymmetry may be a tracer of siphon flows or different heating intensity between the two legs.~Giovanni Peres (MEDOC)~This proposal aims at using EIT, SUMER and CDS to collect images (spectroheliograms) of usual hot coronal loops as well as of the cold EUV loops rooted in sunspot umbrae, in emission lines forming at temperatures ranging from the chromosphere to the corona. The time cadence of observations was selected to study the slow evolution of active regions and of EUV cold sunspot loops. Studying the slow evolution is important per se and to determine possible non-equilibrium condition of large loops. For instance the sunspot loops have been observed to evolve over hours, i.e. in the range of their estimated dynamic and thermodynamic time scale. A companying proposal by Reale et al. is dedicated to fast time scale evolution of loops.~CDS;SUMER;EIT~1997/10/27~1997/11/09~

5605~JOP098~Multi-Wavelength Obs. of Solar Flares~~Neale Ranns; Charles Kankelborg~1999 March 8, 15:34-17:00 TRACE (coordinated with VLA: Rob Willson) observed AR on NW limb in 1600 AA, 171 AA, and 284 AA. No major events noted. 1999 March 9, TRACE observed AR 8477 and AR 8483. No major events. Some interesting topology and signs of emerging flux (beginnings of AR 8486). Otherwise, it is a typical region, i.e.: 171 AA moss, a profusion of loops that meander through the coronal volume, low-amplitude waves (or is it flow?) propagating out of the coronal fans seen in 171 AA. Small amounts of streaming dark material. Hot flows in some of the low-lying loops. 1999 March 10 00:00-08:00 TRACE observing AR 8477, 8483, 8486. I ve seen only the data prior to 04:42. Plenty of microflaring, but no major events. 1999 March 11 00:00-08:00, TRACE observing AR 8477, 8483, 8486. The very first EUV (171 AA) frame taken by TRACE at 00:07 shows a brilliant diffraction pattern corresponding to a C-9 flare in AR 8483, near the SW limb. The diffraction images show an X shape. Subsequent to the flash, a host of new loops brighten and a helmet-like cusp forms, squirting material out of the helmet spike. The event time coincides with a small CME observed by LASCO (00:12). The JOP 98 observations (00-08 UT) also show several dark prominences at the limb, including one large, persistent structure with a remarkable cruciform shape. 1999 March 11, 15:30-19:00 TRACE (coordinated with VLA: Rob Willson) observed in 171, 284, and 1600, targeting the active region complex at the SW limb (8477, 8483, 8486). Used 2x2 summing in the EUV images to keep the cadence up (40 sec). Occasional context images were taken at full resolution. We caught a flare at 17:16:59, with a very nice double diffraction pattern. The high cadence affords a very smooth movie of a resulting spray seen in 284, 171, and 1600. This event may be of interest to Jop98 participants, because we have pre-event data at very high cadence in full-resolution 1600.

5870~ICAL06~Intercalibration 006~SERTS sounding rocket underflight calibration for SOHO.~Roger Thomas; Barbara Thompson; Jeff Brosius~We have selected X = -450 arcsec, Y = +300 arcsec as the center of the 4 arcmin by 4 arcmin CDS field of view for the SERTS flight on June 24. The SERTS roll angle will be 90 degrees, i.e., the slit will be perpendicular to the solar rotation axis. SERTS spectra and spectroheliograms will be obtained at three different, parallel pointings, each separated by 90 arcsec. (Thus the maximum separation between parallel slit pointings will be 3 arcmin.) Ideally, all three slit positions will lie within the CDS, EIT, TRACE, and SXT fields of view. During SERTS launch, SSR will be in record for CDS, 16:15-17:55 UT. One final note about the SERTS pointing for June 24, in case it was not clear from the earlier message: the three SERTS pointing positions will be offset from one another by 90 arcsec in the North-South direction, i.e., perpendicular to our East-West slit orientation. Thus the horizontal slit will twice undergo a 90 arcsec vertical translation during the flight. The center of the 4 arcmin by 4 arcmin CDS field of view remains X = -450 arcsec, Y = +300 arcsec, which corresponds to about 20 degrees North and 30 degrees East. Yohkoh Comments from Yohkoh Planner (Piet Martens) ------------------------------------------------ The SXT Table that Hugh and I just prepared and sent off, has fixed SXT pointing at N20, E30, with partial frames of 5.2x5.2 arcmin square FOV. SXT will cycle through 5 filters, once with adjustable and once with fixed exposures. After these 10 images there is a dark current calibration partial frame image. This program will be overidden by flare mode, should a flare occur anywhere on the Sun. Note that a major flare has been forecast for the SERTS target region. Hugh has calculated that SXT should be in high rate during the time of the flight. In contrast to our earlier plans, this SXT observing program will start already after the first KSC pass for today, at 11:33 UT, to have better overlap with CDS. This program will be replced by the regular Max Millennium 01 observations at 18:25 UT. SXT got 11 good partial frame images in full resolution of the target area during the SERTS rocket flight, cycling twice through five filters, and making one dark calibration image. Exposures in the two cycles are rather different, as we had planned, so the dynamic range can be extended considerably by combining images in the same filter. We also have two good full disk images for the time of the flight. There are a lot of interesting structures in the SXT images, including an Y- or X-type loop, but there is very little variation during the 10 minutes. I am putting together an SXT science nugget, comparing the SXT and TRACE images during the flight at: http://www.solar.isas.ac.jp/sxt_co/990625.html Hugh Hudson has put the SXT data, and the journal of an IDL session prepping the images, in the form of an .genx file for anyone to use in: ftp://isass0.solar.isas.ac.jp/pub/serts/ CDS: Three rasters were taken of the SERTS target, before, during and after the rocket flight. Post-flight analysis shows that we have good co-alignment.

5975~JOP106~Sigmoidal Active Region Study~We will study sigmoidal structures and other CME tracers on the solar disk over a range of wavelengths, and also determine the underlying magnetic field from vector and line-of-sight magnetogram data. We will choose a clear sigmoid appearing in the Eastern hemisphere, and follow it with coordinated observations of its structure in multiple wavelengths. If it is still sigmoidal when it reaches the West limb, we will add coronagraph data in order to better study its manifestation at the solar limb. If it erupts, we will gather pre-eruption and post-eruption on-disk and coronagraph data to be compared. We will also look for signatures in interplanetary scintillation observations (IPS), and study the geo-effectiveness of any eruption, using space and earth-based in-situ instrumentation.~Sarah Gibson; Doug Biesecker~target of opportunity for WSM#3 This is part of the Max Millennium Observing Program #002.

6050~Campaign~Williams College Expedition Support~To observe the solar corona during the total solar eclipse of 11 August 1999 and to use those observations to follow coronal structure seen in EIT silhouetted against the solar disk up over the limb into the middle corona.~Barbara Thompson; Jay M. Pasachoff~We successfully observed the total solar eclipse of 11 August 1999 from Rimnicu Vilcea, Romania. We obtained 11 CCD images in the [Fe XIV] green line at 530.3 nm at various exposure times to display the corona over a wide range of intensities beyond the limb. Thus far we have made a composite image out of our photographic white-light results, and merged the image with EIT images that are themselves merged to bring out coronal structure; we have displayed such images at www.williams.edu/astronomy/eclipse99. The reduction of the CCD images and their merging with EIT on their inside and LASCO on their outside is to be the senior thesis of Daniel Seaton 01 at Williams College. We have also so far reduced high-temporal-resolution [Fe XIV] green-line data showing coronal loops on the northwest limb, a region chosen in consultation with SOHO/EIT and TRACE scientists; a paper on similar 1998 data has just been accepted at Solar Physics and reduction of the 1999 data is continuing as the senior thesis of Kevin Russell 00. Further, as the senior thesis of Sara Kate May 00, we have reduced polarized images obtained through three filters between 400 and 4250 nm to follow the method of Cram in mapping coronal temperature by studying the relation of the photospheric spectrum as viewed directly with that same spectrum as scattered off the fast coronal electrons. We are reporting the observations at the eclipse symposium at the Institut d Astrophysique in Paris at the April 14/15, 2000, meeting and at the Rochester AAS meeting in June 2000.~EIT; Williams College Expedition (GBO)~1999/08/11~1999/08/11~

This collection of data are calibrated to derive polarized brightness maps, spanning a time interval of about 100 minutes. No major CME occured during this time interval. More subtle changes will be investigated, in particular loop and filament expansions near the NW limb, that might be early precusors of a large CME that went off there 10 hours after eclipse time.~MDI; LASCO; EIT; Royal Observatory of Belgium (GBO); JOSO TECONet Expedition (GBO)~1999/08/11~1999/08/11~

6060~Campaign~French Institutes Expedition Support~A team of several french Labs (the Paris Inst-t d Astrophysique-CNRS; the Orsay Inst-t d Astrophysique Spatiale; the Marseille LAS, etc.) did prepare a series of ground-based eclise exp-ts to analyze the eclipse and post-eclipse corona. Objectives mainly cover 1/ The analysis of the W-L intermediate corona (not seen with the Lasco C2 coronagraph), with high spatial resolution, to understand the origine of the extended coronal structure, including fine rays above active regions and high loops; 2/ the spectroscopic analysis of the main parts of the inner and intermediate (up to 2 solar radii) corona at 2 different spectral resolutions, to look at the coronal temperature distribution with a special attention to the extraction of the non thermal velocities from the Fe XIV 530.3 line profile; and 3/ additional exp-ts like narrow passband imagery and polarimetry of the more external corona simultaneously observed with the Lasco C2 coronagraph. All G-B exp-ts performed well during the beautifull eclipse totality we experienced in the central part of Iran (near Chadagan); the data are now analyzed taking into account the accurately collected SoHO data (EIT; Lasco) before, during and especially, after the eclipse totality. Some TRACE data were also collected in a limb NW region. G-B calibration will also be used to interpret some of the Spaceborne data. It is apparently the 1st time that a full disk EIT image in HeII 304 was made strictly simultaneously with a high resolution W-L color image of the corona which shows, at the same resolution, all Halpha emissions (see additional comments).~Serge Koutchmy; Barbara Thompson~At the time of this Aug. 11, 1999 eclipse we were lucky to have several very interesting phenomena going on into the corona: First, a big CME at the NW limb, which exploded several hours after the totality, above a HIGH W-L LOOP of Romanesque style (0.75 R above the solar surface) that we well observed, slowly evolving over an extended region with several filaments and prominence ejecta (also studied with TRACE data in coronal lines). Cavities of different scales are observed there but NO helmet streamer of Gothic style around it can be identified. The EIT movie in FeXII 195 shows a now classical prominence eruption with spiraling threads evolving from absorption to emission and subsequent blowing up of the whole coronal region. Further, the CME is well followed on C2 and C3 Lasco images and surprinsingly enough, a rather constant proper motion velocity of 440 km/s is measured over a more than 20 R fov. However, it is not easy to look at the continuity between what is observed on the EIT coronal movie and what can be identified among the Lasco W-L structures. The eclipse observation of a high loop (with inserted inside cavities) without any helmet streamer prior to the initiation of the CME is unique. The spectroscopic analysis (eclipse spectra) of the prominence part which is, later on, blowing up to form the heart of the CME, is also unique. Further, above the NE limb, we observed the corona overlying a large active region where the emission of the CaXV line is registered (coronal condensation). Small prominence ejecta and plasmoides are abondantly observed and much further out, very fine rays and threads. Because type III radio bursts were registered with the Nancay Decameter Network, we speculate on the origine of some of the finest quasi-radial rays being the W-L counterparts of the beam of relativistic electrons and supra-thermal particles responsible for the Radio-bursts. We succeeded in finding at least 2 fine rays of the best eclipse radially filtered image showing some definite traces on the Lasco processed C2 image taken 10 mn after (image available on the Web)....more info in attachment...~EIT; LASCO~1999/08/11~1999/08/11~cmp_6060.jpg; cmp_6060.txt

6150~Campaign~Polar Coronal Holes~Study of the corona above North Pole near the period of maximum activity. O VI resonance doublet lines observed by UVCS and SUMER, as well as lines of Si XII. Support by SUMER very useful to fill the gap from 1.0 to 1.5 Rsun, not covered by UVCS. Moreover, SUMER observed the solar disk, near the limb, in order to provide data for stray light correction of UVCS data and for the study of Doppler dimming of O VI resonance doublet lines.~Daniele Spadaro~Observations were obtained with a very good signal to noise ratio for both instruments. Analysis is in progress. Quick look of UVCS data showed a significant emission in the Si XII lines even at 1.5 - 2.0 Rsun, which implies a high density and temperature in the extended corona also above the North pole. This result is interesting if compared to analogous observations obtained during the phases of solar minimum activity, when the emission in the extended corona above polar regions was negligible in lines of highly charged ions.~UVCS; SUMER~1999/10/04~1999/10/17~

However, it appeared that the target had been ejected by the next day. The decision was made to continue the JOP for at least one more day to see if the target loop would reform. On Friday, 21-Apr-2000, the decision was made that the target was no longer there, and the remainder of JOP 119 was cancelled.~CDS; MDI; EIT; TRACE (S/C); Yohkoh (S/C)~2000/04/10~2000/04/21~

6380~Campaign~VLA Active Region Campaign~This campaign will attempt to observe the initiation and evolution of an "EIT Wave" transient with multiple observatories, with the scientific aim of detecting a radio signature of the event, and to increase our understanding of the origin and development of these transients. By combining both radio and coronal observations of an EIT wave transient, we hope to observe both the development of the event in the corona in conjunction with observations of either a coronal shock in radio or other radio signature. The H alpha observations will assist in determining whether the event had a "Moreton-Ramsey Wave." Ideally, the development of the flare, coronal field evolution, and wave and shock development will be observed, so that their relative associations can be delineated. Target will be either disk center or a region which appears likely to produce an EIT wave. The likelihood of a region producing such an event appears to be a factor of the region s history of producing events, combined with the probability that the region will produce flares or exhibit any other type of evolution.~Charles Kankelborg; Barbara Thompson~Planned for April 1,2,3, and 8~VLA (GBO); TRACE (S/C); EIT; Yohkoh (S/C); BBSO (GBO)~2000/04/01~2000/04/08~

6630~Campaign~Photospheric Magnetic Signature Study~The purpose of this observation is to study photospheric magnetic signatures associated with slowly changing coronal features using vector magnetic fields accurately determined by ASP observations. Mr. Kubo, a graduate student in University of Tokyo, is now studying an emerging active region appeared in September 1994, using simultaneous ASP and Yohkoh/SXT data (unfortunately, SoHO and TRACE were not on orbit at that time). I believe it would be valuable to include low temperature coronal data observed with TRACE and SoHO (EIT, CDS, MDI for magnetogram), because > > these low temperature coronal loops are rooted into different places at the photosphere from the footpoints of hot coronal loops observed with Yohkoh/SXT, and I would like to arrange TRACE, SoHO, and Yohkoh with ASP observations.~Ted Tarbell; Toshifumi Shimizu~Toshifumi Shimizu (shimizu@sxt2.mtk.nao.ac.jp)~TRACE (S/C); MDI; Sac Peak~2000/11/14~2000/11/21~

State Observatory observations from Dr. Wahab Uddin (e-mail: wahab@upso.ernet.in) (1) On 20th December 2000 we have recorded filament activation in prime target. It shows high blue shift in some parts. Which later on erupted and observed with SOHO EIT and with Mk4,PICS etc. as reported by Joseph B. Gurman and Tom Holzer by e-mail. (2) On 22nd December 2000 we have recorded promenence eruption in target 3 on the east limb. The important thing is, during eruption it shows spray like structure. (3) On 23rd December 2000 we have recorded flare associated surge near South- East limb from newly emerging region. This region also seems a good target which is not included in JOP 135 targets. Some images of the above observations are available at the anonymous site (upso.upso.ernet.in). The zipped file names are as under: (i) a.1.fits.gz (22nd Dec. 2000, 03:35:34 UT, spray like eruption, in target 3) (ii) a.2.fits.gz (20th Dec. 2000, 02:19:03 UT, filament -0.5 A in prime target) (iii) a.3.fits.gz (20th Dec 2000, 02:19:21 UT, filament on band in prime target) (iv) a.4.fits.gz (20th Dec 2000, 02:20:00 UT, filament -1.0 A in prime target) (v) a.5.fits.gz (23rd Dec 2000, 08:28:11 UT, flare associated surge near South-East limb).

7266~JOP202~Origin of the slow solar wind~Our primary goal is to understand the nature and origin ofthe slow solar wind and its relation to coronal streamers. We will characterize solar wind source regions from streamers, including their boundaries and helmet tops. Velocity measurements will be made using Doppler dimming and correlation tracking of plasma blobs in white light. Abundance measurements will be made both in the corona and in the solar wind to track the origin of solar wind streams. In situ and IPS measurements of wind speeds will be used to map the slow wind streams from the Sun to the heliosphere. In the event there is a cavity within the streamer, the lower coronal observations in the core of the streamer will obtain cavity observations.~Leonard Strachan~A Whole Heliosphere Interval JOP~CDS;EIT;LASCO;UVCS;ACE (S/C);Geotail (S/C);Hinode-XRT (S/C);STEREO-SECCHI (S/C);TRACE (S/C);Ulysses (S/C);EISCAT;MLSO;Nagoya;Nancay;OOTY;SMEI~2008/03/27~2008/04/02~

7295~Campaign~Quiet Sun Supergranular EUV Brightenings~Study near-simultaneously in two passbands the spectrum of EUV brightenings in the quiet Sun that are related to the relentless evolution of the quiet Sun magnetic field on the supergranular scale.~Scott McIntosh; Davina Innes~The observed brightenings relate to the formation and destruction of EUV brightpoints as well as the persistent advection of magnetic flux toward the network boundaries/vertices that have been connected to phenomena such as macro-spicules, explosive-events [McIntosh 2007a, 2007b] and most-recently small-scale CMEs [Innes et al. 2008]. STEREO/SECCHI observations offer us an unprecedented opportunity to study such brightenings at two wavelengths [in the transition region/low corona at 304 A and in the 1MK corona at 171 A] simultaneously prior to the launch of SDO. The temporal phasing and co-spatiality of the observed brightenings and small-CMEs will be coordinated through the novel analysis of the observed light-curves in the overlapping region of the spacecraft [McIntosh 2007a, 2007b]. EIT, in 304 A, will offer regular cadence observations of the STEREO overlap region and the potential of stereoscopic imaging between the three spacecraft. High resolution magnetic information will be provided for the overlapping target region by SOT/NFI and SP. In this way we will be able to investigate the high-sensitivity magnetic field measurements at the root of the small-scale EUV observed.~EIT;STEREO-SECCHI;Hinode-EIS~2009/02/12~2009/02/15~
