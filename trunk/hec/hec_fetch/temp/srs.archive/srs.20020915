Analysis of recent data indicating a restructuring
of the magnetic field and the materialization of 
satellite spots warranted the separation of the 
two main clusters of spots in Region 105 
(now centered at S07W18).  Newly numbered 
Region 114 (S12W02) is the trailing portion of 
spots previously included in Region 105.
