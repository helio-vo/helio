This message is for users of the NOAA/SEC Space 
Weather Operations sunspot region numbers. As you 
may have noticed, region number 10000 was assigned
on June 14. Space Weather operations is going 
through the sequence of Region numbers as 9998, 
9999, 0000, 0001, and so on. SEC's product text 
discussions of the active regions will ignore the 
leading zeroes (for example, we will say 'Region 
number 5' rather than Region number '0005'). However, 
the Geoalert product, the Region Report product, as 
well as the USAF and IUWDS data exchange codes will 
preserve the 4 digit format. The necessity of using 
four digits is for operational purposes only. For 
historical purposes all regions beyond Region 9999 
will be understood to be in a series of region numbers 
10000 and higher.
