Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 025 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Jan 2012
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Jan
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  Proton levels are high.  The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux event that began at 23/0530Z, reached a new maximum of
6310 pfu at 24/1530Z.  Flux values since the onset of this event
have decreased below 1000 pfu and are currently at 744 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels with isolated minor to major storm periods.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
