B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 100 MeV proton event at
geosynchronous orbit that began at 07/0405Z, reached a maximum of 69
pfu at 07/1525Z, and ended at 10/1650Z.  The greater than 10 MeV
proton event at geosynchronous orbit that began at 07/0510Z, reached
a maximum of 6530 pfu at 08/1115Z, was still ongoing at the close of
the period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Field activity ranged from quiet
to major storm levels due to continued effects from a CME passage.
