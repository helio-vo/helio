SGAS Number 028 Issued at 0245Z on 28 Jan 2012
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 27 Jan

B.  Proton Events:  Proton levels are high.  A 10 MeV proton event
began at 27/1905Z and reached a peak of 701 pfu at 28/0105Z.  A 100
MeV proton event began at 27/1900Z and reached a peak of 11.9 pfu at
27/2140Z.  These events are still in progress.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic activity was quiet to
unsettled.  Minor storm levels were observed at high latitudes.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available

F.  Comments:  The reported 10cm flux value was flare enhanced by an
X1.7 event that occurred at 27/1837Z.  

Estimated 10cm flux is
approximately 120 sfu.
