SGAS Number 203 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Jul 2012
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Jul

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux at
geosynchronous orbit exceeded the 10 pfu threshold at 17/1715Z,
reached a maximum of 136 pfu at 18/0600Z, and is still ongoing at
the time of this report.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  Two active periods were observed at the
Boulder magnetometer, and isolated active and minor storm periods
were observed at high latitudes.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
