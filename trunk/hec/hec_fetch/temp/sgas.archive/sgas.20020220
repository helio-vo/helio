Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 051 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Feb 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Activity was at quiet to unsettled
levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm Alert Exists Stratwarm Tuesday
The circulation remains very disturbed after the recent major warming
are now no longer fulfilled, but only narrowly so. There exists a
reversal in zonal mean wind from 5 HPA upwards and in zonal mean
temperature from 50 HPA upwards.
