Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 159 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Jun 2011
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0616 0641 0659  1226 S21W54 M2.5  2n 6400   710    II/IV           
B.  Proton Events:  10 MeV and 100 MeV proton events are in progress.
The greater than 10 MeV proton flux began at 07/0820Z and reached a
peak flux of 72.9 pfu at 07/1820Z. The greater than 100 MeV proton
flux began at 07/0720Z and reached a peak of 4.5 pfu at 07/1025Z.
Both of these events are associated with the M2/2N flare at 07/0641Z
from Region 1226 and are currently declining.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
