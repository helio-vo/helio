Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10MeV proton event which began
on 25 September remains in progress.  Peak flux was 12900 pfu at
25/2235 UTC.  Current flux levels (at 29/2400 UTC) are about 22 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity was
quiet to minor storm.  A 17 nT sudden impulse was observed on the
Boulder magnetometer at 29/0940 UTC, preceded by an earlier shock
passage observed on the ACE satellite.  Several active periods and
an isolated minor storm period occurred through the remainder of the
day.  Solar wind speed remains elevated and IMF signatures suggest
the predominant influence of a coronal hole high speed stream.

optical flare from Region 9628 (S17W48) at that time.
