Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 182 Issued at 0245Z on 30 Jun 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 29 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active. The disturbed periods are due to a coronal hole
high speed stream that began yesterday and peaked at near 600 km/s
midway through the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
