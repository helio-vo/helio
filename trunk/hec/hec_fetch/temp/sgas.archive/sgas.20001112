Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 317 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Nov 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1842 1843 1845                       120                           
B.  Proton Events:  The proton event at greater than 100 MeV ended at
11/0240Z.  The greater than 10 MeV protons continued to decrease
during the period but have remained steady for the last several
hours at approximately 22 pfu.  The 10 MeV proton event is expected
to end sometime within the next 24 hours.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.  Solar wind measurements from the ACE spacecraft indicate
the onset of a high-speed , low density  flow that is consistent
with a favorably positioned solar coronal hole.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
