Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 354 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Dec 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active.  Solar wind speed showed an increase up to about
470 km/s after 1700Z, which was accompanied by a southward
interplanetary magnetic field.  The solar wind speed had declined to
about 420 km/s at time of issue.
