B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active with minor storm periods at high latitudes. High
speed coronal hole effects with persistent southward Bz are causing
the disturbance. There are also indications of a weak transient
passage late in the period, which is enhancing this disturbance. The
greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached
high levels.
