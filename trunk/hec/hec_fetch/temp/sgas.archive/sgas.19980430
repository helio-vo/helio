B.  PROTON EVENTS:  A WEAK ENERGETIC PROTON (GT 10 MEV) ENHANCEMENT
BEGAN AT 30/0405Z. MAXIMUM FLUX WAS 2 PFU. THIS ENHANCEMENT IS
ATTRIBUTED TO THE M6/HALO CME OBSERVED ON 29 APR.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET
UNTIL A 31NT SUDDEN IMPULSE WAS OBSERVED AT 30/0933Z. THIS WAS
PRECEDED BY A SHOCK PASSAGE AT THE ACE SPACECRAFT AT 30/0845Z. AFTER
THE SUDDEN IMPULSE, UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED.
THIS DISTURBANCE IS BELIEVED TO BE RELATED TO THE X1/HALO CME
OBSERVED ON 27 APR. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS
ORBIT WERE PREDOMINANTLY HIGH.
