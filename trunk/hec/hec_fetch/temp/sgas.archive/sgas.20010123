Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 023 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Jan 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  A minor enhancement of the greater than 10 MeV
protons was observed at geostationary orbit.  The peak flux was
around 3 pfu, staying well below event level threshold.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
