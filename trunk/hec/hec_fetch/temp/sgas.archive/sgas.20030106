Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 006 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Jan 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Jan
A.  Energetic Events

None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit reached moderate levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/SUNDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
UPPER STRATOSPHERIC WARMING, CENTERED WITH PLUS 22C AT 1HPA OVER
70N/40E, CONTINUES, SLOWLY WEAKING;  TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN
60N AND THE POLE REVERSED BETWEEN 10 AND 1 HPA;  EASTERLY WINDS AT
60N, 1HPA.
