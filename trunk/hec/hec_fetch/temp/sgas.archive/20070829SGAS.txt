Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 241 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Aug 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  A transient disruption in the solar wind occurred at
approximately 0930 UTC.  This resulted in one period of minor
storming at mid-latitudes and one period of major storming at
high-latitudes.  NOTE:  The planetary K values for the 00-03, 03-06,
and 06-09 periods were lost due to a data outage and are
irretrievable.  The final planetary A index can not be calculated
without the three missing K values.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
