B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 30/0245 UTC remains in progress,  peak flux was 108 pfu at
31/1620 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The Geomagnetic field was at quiet
levels.  The >10 MeV proton event that began on 30/0245 UTC remains
in progress,  peak flux was 108 pfu at 31/1620 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists.  Major warming continues. 
The warming over the polar region is leading to a reversed
temperature gradient between 50 and 3 HPA, with easterly zonal mean
zonal winds from 10 to 2 HPA.
