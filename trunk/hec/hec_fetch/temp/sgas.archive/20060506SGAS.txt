Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 126 Issued at 0245Z on 06 May 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.  The elevated conditions were due to a
co-rotating interaction region.
