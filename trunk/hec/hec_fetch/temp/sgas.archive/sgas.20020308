Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 067 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Mar 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Mar

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field activity was
at quiet to active levels.  An isolated minor storm condition was
observed at Fredericksburg at 06/2100 UTC, believed to be a result
of a large, transequatorial coronal hole during it's waning stage. 
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit has
been elevated throughout the period following the passage of the
high speed stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM THURSDAY
IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE, STILL DISTURBED CONDITIONS
AFTER THE WARMING.  STILL A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT AT 10HPA,
BUT FURTHER RETURNING TO NORMAL CONDITIONS.  END OF THIS ALERT
PERIOD.
