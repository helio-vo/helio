B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 30/0245 UTC reached a maximum flux of 108 pfu at 31/1620 UTC. 
This event has been on a very slow decrease since max and is at 28
pfu at the time of this writing.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet to unsettled levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM WEDNESDAY
MAJOR WARMING CONTINUES.  IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE, A
WARM REGION IN THE POLAR REGION IS STILL LEADING TO A REVERSED
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT DOWN TO 50HPA.  THERE ARE EASTERLY ZONAL MEAN
WINDS AT 60N FROM 10HPA TO 1HPA.
