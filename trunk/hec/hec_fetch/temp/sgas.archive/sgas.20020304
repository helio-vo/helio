Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 063 Issued at 0245Z on 04 Mar 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 03 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to unsettled, with a single active period during 03/2100-2400
UTC.  Sustained southward IMF with increasing density and velocity,
probably resulting from a CIR ahead of an expected onset of high
speed stream effects, is the likely cause of the active period.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM SUNDAY
Throughout the stratosphere, still disturbed circulation pattern with
the warm air over the polar region and Asia and a displaced vortex
over northern Siberia, leading to a reversed temperature gradient
between the pole and 60N from 100HPa up to 1Hpa
