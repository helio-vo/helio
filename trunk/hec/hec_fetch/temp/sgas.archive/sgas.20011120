Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 324 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Nov 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event at
geosynchronous orbit began at 19/1230 UTC. This event remains in
progress with a peak flux so far of 33 pfu at 19/2340 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels. A sudden impulse was observed at ground
magnetometers (10 nT at Boulder) at about 19/1815 UTC.
