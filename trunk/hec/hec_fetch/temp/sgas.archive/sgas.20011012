Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 285 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Oct 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Oct

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic activity was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  Quiet to unsettled conditions persisted
until 11/1700 UTC when a 11 nT sudden impulse was observed.  Active
to minor storming conditions have persisted since the shock which is
believed to be associated with the 09/1113 UTC M1/2f flare and CME.
