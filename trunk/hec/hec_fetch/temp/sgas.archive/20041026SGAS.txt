Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 300 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Oct 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with an active period on 25 October between 0900 and 1200
UTC.  The active period was most likely due to a geoeffective
coronal hole.  ACE data show solar wind speed has remained around
500 km/s, however the total interplanetary magnetic field strength
has decreased from approximately 10 nT to 4 nT.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
