Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 155 Issued at 0245Z on 03 Jun 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 02 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 2310 0000 2315                                     II              
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Solar wind speed remains elevated due to a large
transequatorial coronal hole that has rotated into a geoeffective
position.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
