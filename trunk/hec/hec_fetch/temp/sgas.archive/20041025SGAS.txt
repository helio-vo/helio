Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 299 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Oct 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Oct

B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.  Solar wind speed increased from approximately 360 km/s
to 500 km/s, most likely due to a geoeffective coronal hole.   A
prolonged period of the southward Bz component was responsible for
the unsettled conditions experienced.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
