Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 012 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Jan 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 10/2045 utc, reached a tentative maximum of 91 pfu at 11/0530
UTC. The flux is slowly declining.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to active levels, due to a high speed solar wind stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
