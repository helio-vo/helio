JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 039 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 08 FEB 1997
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 07 FEB
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
NONE
B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
D.  STRATWARM:  STRATWARM ALERT/FRIDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
ONE LARGE WARMING OVER SOUTHWESTERN EUROPE AND THE OTHER
LARGE WARM REGION FURTHER OVER EASTERN EUROPE ACROSS
CENTRAL SIBERIA TO EASTERN SIBERIA.  DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN THE
UPPER STRATOSPHERE RESULTING IN A REVERSED RADIANCE
GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE AT 1, 4 HPA.
E.  DAILY INDICES:
10 CM 076  SSN 038  AFR/AP 004/003   X-RAY BACKGROUND A3.5
DAILY PROTON FLUENCE (FLUX ACCUMULATION OVER 24 HRS)

3 HOUR K-INDICES:
BOULDER 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 PLANETARY 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 2 
F.  COMMENTS:  H-ALPHA, YOHKOH, AND SPACE-BASED CORONAGRAPH DATA
INDICATE A LARGE CME OCCURRED TODAY AT APPROXIMATELY 07/0230Z. THE
CME SPANNED THE SOLAR DISK FROM THE WEST LIMB NEAR N00W90,
SOUTHEASTWARD ALONG THE SOUTHERN POLAR CROWN FILAMENT CHANNEL, TO
THE EAST LIMB NEAR S40E90. THIS SUGGESTS A SPAN OF SOME 200 DEGREES.
