B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels.  And extended interval of active
conditions, with an isolated period of major storming at high
latitudes, appeared to occur primarily due to a sustained strong
southward orientation of Bz, and a slow increase in solar wind
speed.  Other solar wind data suggest an overall pattern of a CIR
evolving toward to a weak high speed stream pattern near the end of
the period.
