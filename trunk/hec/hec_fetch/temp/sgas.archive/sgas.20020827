Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 239 Issued at 0245Z on 27 Aug 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0039 0103 0125  0083 S19W45 M1.8  Sf 100

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event ended at
26/1335 UTC ( start at 24/0140 UTC and 317 pfu peak at 24/0835 UTC).
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels. A shock in the solar wind was observed
by the NASA ACE spacecraft at 26/1048 UTC. The most active 3-hour
geomagnetic period was 26/1500 to 1800 UTC. This activity is
believed to be related to the M5 flare/CME event which occurred on
22 August.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
