B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton fluxes reached
alert levels at 02/1105Z and were initially believed to have been
from the M3 event earlier in the period (early maximum was 30 pfu). 
Since the X8 event they have seen a maximum of 1510 pfu at 02/2305Z.
The greater than 100 MeV proton fluxes have also reached alert
levels due to the X8 event; at 1740 (15 minutes from the flare
maximum) they pushed through event threshold and have since seen a
maximum of 49 pfu at 02/1915Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  Isolated minor storm conditions
are likely due to the continued elevated solar wind speeds and the
occasional southward Bz in the interplanetary magnetic field.
