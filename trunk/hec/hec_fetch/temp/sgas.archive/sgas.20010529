Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 149 Issued at 0245Z on 29 May 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1449 1449 1450                       110                           
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels. Sustained southward Bz contributed to active
conditions from 28/0900Z through the end of the period. This
activity appears to be associated with the passage of the structure
(CME) following yesterday's 27/1456Z shock.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
