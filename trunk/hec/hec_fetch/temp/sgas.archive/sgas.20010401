B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
severe storm levels.  A shock passed the ACE spacecraft at 31/0023
UT and subsequently reached Earth's magnetic field at 31/0051.   The
storm developed after that time and reached maximum intensity after
31/0900 UT.  It has continued into the later hours of the UT days.  
Dynamic auroral displays were reported across the United States with
especially dynamic displays reported in Arizona, west Texas and
California.  The solar proton event that began at 29/1000 UT was
declared over at 01/0600 UT.
