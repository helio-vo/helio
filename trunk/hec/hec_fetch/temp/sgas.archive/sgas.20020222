B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV protons at geosynchronous
orbit remain elevated following the small proton event that began
and ended between 20/0730 - 0800Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM THURSDAY
THE CIRCULATION IS STILL RELAXING AFTER THE MAJOR WARMING.  THERE
EXISTS A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT FROM 50 HPA AT 60N AND
ZONAL MEAN EASTERLY WINDS FROM 5 HPA TO 1 HPA.
