B.  Proton Events:  An energetic proton event resulted from the X20
flare.  Greater than 20 MeV particles exceeded event threshold at
02/2340Z, and reached a maximum of 1,110 PFU at 03/0745Z.  The 10
MeV particle event continues in progress but is slowly decreasing. 
Greater than 100 MeV particles also exceeded event threshold,
beginning at 03/0120Z, reaching a maximum of 5.4 PFU at 03/0740Z. 
The greater than 100 MeV particles decreased to event threshold
after 03/1900Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
