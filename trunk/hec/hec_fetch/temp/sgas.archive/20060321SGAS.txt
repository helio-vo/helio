Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 080 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Mar 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels today.  The elevated conditions are due
to a favorably positioned coronal hole.
