Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 104 Issued at 0245Z on 14 Apr 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  A 24 nT sudden impulse was observed on the
boulder magnetometer at 12/2243 UTC.  The sudden impulse is likely
the result of a weak CME shock passage.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
