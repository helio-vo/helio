JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 098 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 08 APR 1999
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 07 APR
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
NONE
B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM
QUIET TO ACTIVE LEVELS. THE MOST DISTURBED PERIOD WAS FROM
07/0000-0300Z. AT THAT TIME, SOLAR WIND DATA DID NOT INDICATE A CME
LIKE SIGNATURE. THIS SLIGHT DISTURBANCE APPEARED TO BE RELATED TO A
CONSISTENTLY SOUTHWARD ORIENTED INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELD.
ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT REACHED HIGH
LEVELS DURING THE PERIOD.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE
E.  DAILY INDICES: (REAL-TIME PRELIMINARY/ESTIMATED VALUES)
10 CM 141  SSN 121  AFR/AP 010/009   X-RAY BACKGROUND C1.0
DAILY PROTON FLUENCE (FLUX ACCUMULATION OVER 24 HRS)
