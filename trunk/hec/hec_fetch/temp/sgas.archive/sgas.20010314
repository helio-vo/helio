Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 073 Issued at 0245Z on 14 Mar 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled throughout the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/TUESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR WARMING THE CIRCULATION
IN THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE REMAINS FURTHER DISTURBED
LEADING TO A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT UP TO 20HPA.
IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE THE COLD AND
ELONGATED POLAR VORTEX WEAKENS.
SLOW TRANSITION TO SUMMER CONDITIONS MOST PROBABLE.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 147  SSN 110  Afr/Ap 006/007   X-ray Background B5.1
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 7.9e+04   GT 10 MeV 1.2e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.60e+06 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
