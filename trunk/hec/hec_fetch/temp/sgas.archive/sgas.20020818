B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled condition with one three-hour period of isolated active
levels at 17/0900 UTC.  Greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit exceeded event threshold at 17/1405 UTC,
reached a peak value of 1350 pfu at 17/1710 UTC and decreased below
threshold levels at 17/1845 UTC.  NASA/ACE data indicates that the
solar wind velocities decreased throughout the day from a peak
velocity of 600 km/s to around 450 km/s due to waning coronal hole
effects.
