Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 067 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Mar 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
active with minor and major storm periods.  Heightened activity was
due to the presence of a geoeffective high speed stream that began
early on 06 March.  Solar wind speed at ACE remained elevated
between 600 km/s and 700 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
