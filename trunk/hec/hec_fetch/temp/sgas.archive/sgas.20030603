B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to major storm levels. The most disturbed periods were
from 02/0600 to 1200 UTC. Solar wind observations suggest that the
expected coronal hole high-speed stream has arrived.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
