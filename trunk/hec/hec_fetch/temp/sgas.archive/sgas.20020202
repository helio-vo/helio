Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 033 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Feb 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  USAF planetary experienced an isolated period
of active conditions from 01/1500 - 1800 UTC.  Shortly after 31/2100
UTC, a shock passage was observed at the ACE satellite.  This was
followed by a sudden impulse of 19 nT observed at Boulder at 01/2127
UTC.  The source region for this weak shock is unknown.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
