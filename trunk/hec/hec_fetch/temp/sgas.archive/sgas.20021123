B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  The transequatorial coronal hole
in the western solar hemisphere continues to elevate the solar wind
(today's approximate average speed of 625 km/s).  The greater than 2
MeV electron flux at geosychronous orbit reached high levels today.
