Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 364 Issued at 0245Z on 30 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 29 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to unsettled. Solar wind speed remains elevated -  near 550
km/s, due to a  high speed coronal hole stream. The high speed
stream is declining as the coronal hole rotates out of a
geoeffective position. The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit once again reached high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT / SUNDAY / STRATWARM EXISTS
INTENSE WARMING COMTINUES IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE.  WITHIN THE NEXT
THREE DAYS: EASILY WINDS AT 60N IN 1 HPA; REVERSED TEMPERATURE
GRADIENT BETWEEN THE NORTH POLE AND 60N FROM 10 TO 1 HPA; AN
ELONGATION OF THE COLD POLAR VORTEX INTO TWO CENTRES IN THE LOWER
AND MID-STRATOSPHERE.
