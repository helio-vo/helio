Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 139 Issued at 0245Z on 19 May 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
minor storm conditions.  A shock passed the ACE spacecraft at
18/1919 UTC and created a sudden impulse of 31 nT on the Boulder
magnetometer at 18/2007 UTC.  Solar wind velocity increased from 381
km/s to 450 km/s.  This shock is believed related to the full halo
CME on 16 May.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
