JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 065 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 06 MAR 1999
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 05 MAR
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM
QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.  THIS ACTIVITY WAS BASED ON THE
CONTINUED AFFECTS OF AN ELONGATED CORONAL HOLE STREAM IMPACTING THE
EARTH.  THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRONS AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT
REACHED HIGH LEVELS AT APPROXIMATELY 05/0900Z.
D.  STRATWARM:  STRATWARM ALERT/FRIDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
FINAL WARMING CONTINUES.
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT REVERSED BETWEEN 60N AND
THE POLE IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE STRATOSPHERE,
AND MEAN ZONAL WIND AT 60N FROM THE EAST AT 30 
AND 10 HPA. TRANSMISSION TO SUMMER CONDITIONS
WILL PROCEED WITHIN THE NEXT WEEKS.
END OF GEOALERT MESSAGES OF THIS WINTER SEASON.
