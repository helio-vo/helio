Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 193 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Jul 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Jul
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to major storm levels.  An extended period of southward Bz (-10 nT)
led to the elevated conditions.  An isolated period of major storm
levels was observed between 11/0600 and 11/0900Z.  An increase in
the solar wind speed began near mid-period and is likely to be the
onset of a recurrent coronal hole.
