Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 051 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Feb 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm Alert Exists Monday
Major warming continues.  A large warm area covers the polar region,
Siberia, Europe and the Atlantic region, leading to a reversed
temperature gradient between 60n and the pole in the whole of the
stratosphere. Except in the uppermost level, a polar anticyclone and
a split, southward displaced vortex lead to easterly winds at
latitude 60n throughout the stratosphere.
