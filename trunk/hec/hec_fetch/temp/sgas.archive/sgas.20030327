Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 086 Issued at 0245Z on 27 Mar 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 Mar
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly quiet levels.  The Boulder magnetometer recorded an
active period between 26/0300 and 0600Z.  The greater than 2 MeV
electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
