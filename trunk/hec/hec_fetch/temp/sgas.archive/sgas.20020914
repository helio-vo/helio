B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.  An isolated period of minor storm
conditions existed at mid-latitudes from 13/0600 to 0900 UTC. 
Coronal hole high speed stream effects continued to be the main
source of the elevated activity.  The greater than 2 MeV electron
flux at geosynchronous orbit exceeded event threshold at 13/1620
UTC, reached a maximum value of 1070 pfu at 13/1805 UTC, and fell
below threshold value at 13/1810 UTC.
