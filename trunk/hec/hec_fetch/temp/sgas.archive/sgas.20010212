Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 043 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Feb 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0057 0123 0146  9346 N24W57 C6.5  1f               II              
B.  Proton Events:  An enhancement in the greater than 10 MeV proton
flux at geosynchronous orbit began about 0600 UTC, following the C6
event at 0123 UTC. The particle increase reached the 1 pfu level,
most recently at 1025 UTC, before the slow decay now occurring,
commenced.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly quiet to unsettled. However, brief active conditions
occurred from 0600-0900 UTC at Boulder from a short-lived substorm.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm Alert Exists Stratwarm Sunday
Major warming continues. Temperature gradient between 60N 
and the pole reversed at the 100 to 10 HPA levels. Wind reversal
at 60N/10HPA expected within the next day.
