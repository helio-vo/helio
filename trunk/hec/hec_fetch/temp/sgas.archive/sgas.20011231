Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 365 Issued at 0245Z on 31 Dec 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux at
geosynchronous orbit has fluctuated near the event threshold value
of 10 pfu for most of the day, though now appears to be undergoing
an enhancement due to the recent shock passage.  As a result of
near-threshold activity, a 10 MeV proton event has been in progress
since 30/0245 UTC.  Max flux observed today is 19 pfu, at 30/2355
UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity has
been quiet to active.  Most of the day was dominated by ongoing
effects from yesterday's shock passage, with an extended period of
southward IMF producing active conditions during 30/0300-0900 UTC. 
Active conditions returned late in the day, when an additional shock
passage was observed at the ACE satellite at 30/1932 UTC, followed
by a sudden impulse of 27 nT observed at Boulder at 30/2010 UTC. 
This event is presumed to be an early arrival of effects from the
powerful X-class event of 28 December.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM SUNDAY
WARM AIR COVERS MOST OF THE POLAR REGION IN THE UPPER AND MIDDLE
STRATOSPHERE, FURTHER PENETRATING DOWNWARDS.  THE TEMPERATURE
GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE WILL BE REVERSED DOWN TO 50
HPA, AND MEAN ZONAL EASTERLY WINDS ARE EXPECTED BETWEEN 10 
AND 1 HPA AT 60N.  MAJOR WARMING IN PROGRESS.
