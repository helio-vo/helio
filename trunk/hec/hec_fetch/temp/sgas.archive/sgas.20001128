B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 24/1520Z, reaching a high value of 923 pfu at 26/1955Z, dropped
below threshold level at 27/1435 and hovered just below threshold
for the remainder of the period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
at minor to major storm levels for the first half of the period, and
dropped off to mostly unsettled to active levels for the second half
of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
