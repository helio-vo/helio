Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 128 Issued at 0245Z on 07 May 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. The high speed solar wind stream that became geoeffective
yesterday remains in effect. Solar wind speed was approximately 540
km/s, but IMF Bz was predominantly northward.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
