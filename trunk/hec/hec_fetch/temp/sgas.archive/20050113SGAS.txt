Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 013 Issued at 0245Z on 13 Jan 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 Jan
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  Minor storm levels occurred due to
the onset of a geoeffective coronal hole.  Solar wind speed has
increased from approximately 400 km/s to 700 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
