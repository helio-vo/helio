Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 057 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Feb 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  Active periods due to the effects of a geoeffective high
speed stream.  Solar wind speed at ACE has increased from
approximately 450 km/s to 550 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
