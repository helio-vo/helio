Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 219 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Aug 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic activity has been at
quiet to severe storm levels, due to increased solar wind speeds
associated with a coronal hole moving into geoeffective position.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
