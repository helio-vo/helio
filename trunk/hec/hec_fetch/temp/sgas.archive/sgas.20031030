B.  Proton Events:  The large proton event and GLE that followed the
X17 flare on 28 Oct was in decline for most of the period. The
greater than 10 MeV proton event that began on 28/1215Z, peaked at
29/0615Z at 29,500 pfu, making it the second largest, greater than
10 MeV proton event this cycle (second only to the 31,700 pfu proton
event in November 2001). The greater than 100 MeV proton event began
at 28/1145Z, and peaked at 29/0015Z at 186 pfu. The proton events
were still in progress when a new stream of protons began, following
the X10 flare at around 2100Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to severe storming. The powerful CME from the X17/4b flare
on 28/1110Z, impacted the Earth's magnetic field at 29/0613Z. The
transit time for this CME was around 19 hours, making it one of the
fastest on record. The sudden impulse measured 140 nT on the Boulder
magnetometer. Strong southward IMF Bz initiated severe (K9) storming
at middle and high latitudes in the 29/0600 - 0900Z period. Mostly
northward Bz occurred from 29/0900 - 1800Z; however, major to severe
storming persisted. A sharp southward turn in the Bz occurred at
around 1800Z ending the period with K8-9 severe storming.  A strong
Forbush decrease (over 20%) is in progress.
