JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 318 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 14 NOV 1999
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 13 NOV
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
 0114 0258 0351  8763 S15E44 M1.3  1F

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO
MINOR STORM.  MINOR STORM CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES
DURING THE LAST HALF OF THE PERIOD.  PROLONGED PERIODS OF NEGATIVE
BZ OBSERVED BY THE ACE SPACECRAFT IN THE SOLAR WIND LED TO THESE
CONDITIONS.  ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT WERE
AT HIGH LEVELS BUT DECREASED TO ENHANCED LEVELS LATER IN THE PERIOD.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE
E.  DAILY INDICES: (REAL-TIME PRELIMINARY/ESTIMATED VALUES)
10 CM 224  SSN 251  AFR/AP 020/031   X-RAY BACKGROUND C1.2
