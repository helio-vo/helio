SGAS NUMBER 206 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 25 JUL 1998
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 24 JUL
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT
UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM LEVELS WITH ISOLATED MAJOR STORM PERIODS
OBSERVED AT HIGH LATITUDES. ACE NEAR-REAL-TIME SOLAR WIND DATA
INDICATED THE ACTIVITY WAS DUE TO A HIGH SPEED STREAM ASSOCIATED
WITH AN EXTENSION OF THE NORTHERN POLAR CORONAL HOLE.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE.
