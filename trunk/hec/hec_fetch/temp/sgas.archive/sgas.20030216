Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 047 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly unsettled to active levels.  An isolated period of
quiet conditions were seen at mid-latitudes between 14/2100 and
2400Z.  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at geosynchronous
orbit reached moderate levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT / SATURDAY / STRATWARM EXISTS.
NEW WARM PULSE DEVELOPING OVER SIBERIA IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER
STRATOSPHERE LEADING TO A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N
AND THE NORTH POLE FROM 10 HPA UP TO 1 HPA.  SPLITTING OF THE VORTEX
THROUGHOUT THE STRATOSPHERE EXPECTED WITHIN THE NEXT THREE DAYS WITH
EASTERLY WINDS IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE FROM 3 HPA TO 1 HPA.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
