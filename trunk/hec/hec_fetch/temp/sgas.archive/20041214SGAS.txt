Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 349 Issued at 0245Z on 14 Dec 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  The elevated conditions were a result of the
observed full halo CME on 8 December.  This activity began tapering
off early in the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
