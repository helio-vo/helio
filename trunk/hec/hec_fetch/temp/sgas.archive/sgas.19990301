JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 061 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 02 MAR 1999
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 01 MAR
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
NONE
B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM
UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM LEVELS. THE MOST DISTURBED PERIODS WERE
01/0000-0600Z AND 01/1200-1800Z. SOLAR WIND DATA SHOWED A LOW SPEED,
HIGH DENSITY FLOW WITH NORTHWARD BZ DURING THE DISTURBANCE. IT IS
POSSIBLE THIS DISTURBANCE WAS RELATED TO A FILAMENT DISRUPTION IN
THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT ON 24-25 FEB. AT THE END OF THE PERIOD, SOLAR
WIND VELOCITY WAS INCREASING AND DENSITY WAS DECREASING.
D.  STRATWARM:  STRATWARM ALERT/MONDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
FINAL WARMING CONTINUES.
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT REVERSED BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE
THROUGHOUT THE STRATOSPHERE.MEAN ZONAL WIND AT 60N CON-
TINUOUSLY WEAKENING IN THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE AND REACHED
EASTERLY DIRECTION AT 10HPA AND ABOVE.
E.  DAILY INDICES: (REAL-TIME PRELIMINARY/ESTIMATED VALUES)
10 CM 120  SSN 127  AFR/AP 023/033   X-RAY BACKGROUND B3.5
DAILY PROTON FLUENCE (FLUX ACCUMULATION OVER 24 HRS)
