F.  Comments:  The Stratwarm alert service provided by the NOAA Space
Environment Center (SEC) will end on 01 December 2004. SEC was
informed that the Free University of Berlin (FUB) will no longer
issue stratwarm alerts. The Berlin group was the responsible agency
for developing and issuing this product.  The stratwarm alerts were
sent to SEC who, in turn, issued the alert to interested customers.
 

The daily development of the stratospheric circulation can still be
found on the FUB web site (http://strat-www.met.fu-berlin.de/). The
general evaluation is, however, left to the user.
