Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 051 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Feb
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  The transient effects that began yesterday,
and produced a structured solar wind, appear to be ending.  At
19/1400 UTC, the steady decline in solar wind velocity reached a
minimum near 500 km/s.  Solar wind velocity has since increased to
560 km/s.  Bz show signs of returning to the fluctuating signature
of a high speed stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/WEDNESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
The wave two pattern persists with a continuing reversed temperature
gradient on all levels and easterly winds on 3 and 5 hpa.
