B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 08 September fell below the 10 pfu threshold today; however, a
new influx of protons has raised levels to around 7 pfu's by the end
of the reporting period and is expected to continue rising.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
unsettled to major storm levels. Storm conditions persisted through
much of this period due to transient flow from the intense CME
activity over the past several days. Conditions returned to
predominantly unsettled levels by the end of the period. Solar wind
speed at ACE remains elevated, but decreased from a high near 770
km/s to approximately 650 km/s by the end of the period.
