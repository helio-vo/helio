SGAS Number 348 Issued at 0245Z on 13 Dec 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  The elevated conditions are
believed to be the result of the long duration C2 flare that
occurred on 8 December.
