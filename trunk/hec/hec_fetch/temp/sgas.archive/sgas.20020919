Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 262 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Sep 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Sep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to unsettled with isolated active periods. The disturbed
conditions are due to the elevated solar wind speed (550 km/s).
D.  Stratwarm:  None
