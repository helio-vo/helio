B.  Proton Events:  A new surge of high energy protons followed the
X-10 flare, enhancing the existing greater than 10 MeV and greater
than 100 MeV proton events from the X17 flare on the 28th. This
enhancement reached 110 pfu (29/2310Z) in the greater than 100 MeV
level, and 3300 pfu (30/1935Z) in the greater than 10 MeV level. A
polar cap absorption continues and the proton event remains in
progress.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly minor to severe storm levels. The intense geomagnetic
storm that began at 29/0611Z continued through the first half of
this period. Severe levels were observed from 30/0000 - 0600Z. A
short-lived "lull" (K5-6) in  activity preceded the onset of another
severe geomagnetic storm. The very fast CME from the X10 flare that
peaked at 29/2049Z impacted the magnetic field at around 30/1600Z -
a remarkably fast 19-hour transit from Sun to Earth. Sustained
southward IMF Bz in the -15 to -30 Nt range is assuring a severe
response.  A Forbush decrease at around 20% remains in progress.
