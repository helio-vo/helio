Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 194 Issued at 0245Z on 13 Jul 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field activity was
at unsettled to minor storm levels.  A coronal hole in the southwest
quadrant in concert with a weak eastern flanking shock, from the
partial halo CME observed on the 7th of July, is believed to be
responsible for the elevated geomagnetic field activity.
