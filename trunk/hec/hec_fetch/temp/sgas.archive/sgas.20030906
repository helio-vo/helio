Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 249 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Sep 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Sep
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Solar wind speed is in gradual decline as the associated
coronal hole moves out of a geoeffective position. Solar wind speed
declined from almost 700 km/s to near 600 km/s over the past 24
hours.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
