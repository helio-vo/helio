B.  PROTON EVENTS:  THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON EVENT ENDED: START
02/0245Z, MAXIMUM OF 42 PFU AT 02/1010Z, AND END 03/1410Z. THE FLUX
REMAINED ENHANCED AT THE END OF THE PERIOD AND WAS GRADUALLY
DECLINING TOWARDS BACKGROUND.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS ACTIVE
DURING THE FIRST THREE HOURS OF THE PERIOD FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF
A WEAK INTERPLANETARY SHOCK OBSERVED AT L1 AT 02/2035Z. FIELD
ACTIVITY DECLINED TO MOSTLY QUIET LEVELS AFTER 03/0300Z. ANOTHER
WEAK SHOCK WAS OBSERVED AT L1 AT 03/2145Z FOLLOWED BY A WEAK SUDDEN
IMPULSE (SI) AT EARTH AT 03/2221Z (12 NT, AS MEASURED BY THE BOULDER
USGS MAGNETOMETER). THE FIELD WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DISTURBED
FOLLOWING THE SI.
