B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD BEGAN THE
PERIOD AT QUIET LEVELS. ACTIVE CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED DURING THE
08/1500-1800Z PERIOD. UNSETTLED CONDITIONS OCCURRED AT THE END OF
THE PERIOD.  NO SHOCK WAS OBSERVED IN THE NEARLY CONTINUOUS SOLAR
WIND RECORD AND VELOCITY WAS RELATIVELY LOW BETWEEN 350-400 KM/S. 
ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT REACHED HIGH
LEVELS DURING THE PERIOD.
