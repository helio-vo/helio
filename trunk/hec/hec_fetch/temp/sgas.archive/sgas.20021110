Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 314 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Nov 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event began at
09/1920 UTC and remains in progress. The flux at 09/2400 UTC was
about 100 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. The field became somewhat disturbed after 09/1800 UTC in
response to a shock observed in the solar wind at about 09/1755 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
