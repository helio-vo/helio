Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 330 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Nov 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was ranged
from quiet to minor storm levels with a brief period of major
storming at the higher latitudes between 25/1200 and 1500Z.  The
elevated conditions are due to a favorably positioned coronal hole.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
