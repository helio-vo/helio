B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels. The Bz component of the
interplanetary magnetic field continues to be predominantly
southward. The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached moderate to
high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
