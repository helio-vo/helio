Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 034 Issued at 0245Z on 03 Feb 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 02 Feb

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field activity was
at quiet to minor storm levels.  An isolated period of minor storm
conditions occurred at 02/0600 - 0900 UTC.  This was preceded with a
sudden impulse at the Boulder magnetometer of 45 nT at 02/0558 UTC. 
This transient is presumed to be related to M3 x-ray flare that
occurred in old Region 9787 at 31/1444 UTC.  The optical correlation
for this flare was attained using SOHO/EIT imagery, as this region
had rotated beyond the west limb.
