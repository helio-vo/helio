Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 291 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Oct 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly quiet with an isolated unsettled period between
16/0000 - 0300Z. Very stable solar wind conditions existed through
the latter half of the period with solar wind speed falling below
350 km/s and the IMF Bz near zero.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 092  SSN 043  Afr/Ap 004/005   X-ray Background A7.1
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 5.9e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.4e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W101 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 5.70e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W74 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 Planetary 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 Mev electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was at high levels.
