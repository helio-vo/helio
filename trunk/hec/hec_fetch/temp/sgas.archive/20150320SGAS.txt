Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 079 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Mar 2015
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at minor
storming levels for the first period. Active levels were recorded
through the next two periods followed by two periods of minor
storming levels. The next two periods saw the geomagnetic field in
unsettled levels with the final period seeing active levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
