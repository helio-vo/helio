B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event (began
22/2320 UTC, max 18900 pfu at 24/0555 UTC) remains in progress
although flux values have been oscillating across event threshold
levels throughout the past ten hours of the period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
