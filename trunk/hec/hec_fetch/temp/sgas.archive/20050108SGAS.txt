Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 008 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Jan 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Jan
A.  Energetic Events

None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to severe storm levels. Transient flow, likely the CME
activity from 04 and 05 January, impacted the geomagnetic field
first at around 07/0900Z. The existing elevated solar wind speed
increased from 500 km/s to just over 600 km/s. Major storming
followed a period of sustained southward Bz to near -10 nT between
07/1300 - 1500Z.  A second disturbance passed the ACE spacecraft at
07/2010Z. Only a weak enhancement was observed on the plasma
measurements; however, the IMF Bz turned sharply southward to near
-20 nT. The geomagnetic field responded with major to severe storm
conditions to end the period.
