B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been
quiet to unsettled. The greater than 100 MeV proton event ended at
19/0325 UTC (start 18/0315 UTC, 12 pfu peak at 18/0600 UTC). The
polar cap absorption (PCA) event has also ended (19/1400 UTC). The
greater than 10 MeV proton event continues in progress (start
18/0315 UTC, 321 pfu peak at 18/1045 UTC, and current flux about 15
pfu at 19/2100 UTC) and is slowly decaying.
