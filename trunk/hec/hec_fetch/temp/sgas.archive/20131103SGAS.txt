B.  Proton Events:  A slight enhancement in the greater than 10 MeV
proton flux at geosynchronous orbit was observed with a maximum of 3
pfu (below 10 pfu threshold) at 02/2000Z.  Proton levels are
currently declining towards background levels.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
