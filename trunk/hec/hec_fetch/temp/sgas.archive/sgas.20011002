B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux hovered
around event threshold (10 pfu) during the first half of the day,
then began a sustained rise at around 01/1145 UTC. This proton event
was in progress as the period ended with a preliminary maximum flux
of 677 pfu detected at 01/2230 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Field activity ranged from
unsettled to major storm levels due to CME passages.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
