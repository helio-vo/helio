Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 094 Issued at 0245Z on 04 Apr 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 03 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled levels.  The high speed stream which began on 30 March is
subsiding, but continued instability in the interplanetary magnetic
field is maintaining our unsettled activity levels.  The greater
than 2 MeV electrons at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 156  SSN 154  Afr/Ap ???/014   X-ray Background B6.5
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.4e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.10e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)

F.  Comments:  Beginning 1500 UTC April 8, SEC 
will begin using data from the GOES 12 satellite, 
and stop receiving GOES 8 data. GOES 12 has the 
new Solar X-Ray Imager (SXI), which will acquire 
real-time, operational images of the solar x-ray 
flux. With the switch from GOES 8 to GOES 12, the 
primary/secondary designations will change. GOES 
12 will be the primary satellite for the SXI. 
All other data, including magnetometer, XRS x-ray 
measurements, and energetic particles, will have 
GOES 10 as their primary source, with GOES 12
as the secondary source where available. Please 
see http://www.sec.noaa.gov/GOES.html for important 
information on this changeover.
