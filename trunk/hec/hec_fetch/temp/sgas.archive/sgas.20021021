B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  The high speed stream continues but effects
are minimal due to a consistently northward Bz.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

F.  Comments:  Daily X-Ray Background Flux value is estimated from
plotted data, pending repair of the automated algorithm.  Repair is
in progress.
