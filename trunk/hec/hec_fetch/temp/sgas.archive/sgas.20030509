Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 129 Issued at 0245Z on 09 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 08 May

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
initially at unsettled levels but has been at active to minor storm
levels since 08/0000 UTC and continuing through the end of the
reporting period (08/2100 UTC). The geomagnetic field continues to
be buffeted by a persistent high speed solar wind stream with
velocities in the 700 to 800 km/s range and Bz values varying
between -8 nT to +1 nT. The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes
continue to be at high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
