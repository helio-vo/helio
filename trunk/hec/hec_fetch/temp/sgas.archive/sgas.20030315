Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 074 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Mar 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Early in the period solar wind velocity increased
to over 600 km/s marking the onset of the expected high speed
stream.  Fluctuations in the Bz component of the interplanetary
magnetic field to -8 nT resulted in isolated active conditions.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
