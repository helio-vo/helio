Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 108 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Apr 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Two period of active conditions were observed due
to elevated wind speed and a weak coronal hole influence.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
