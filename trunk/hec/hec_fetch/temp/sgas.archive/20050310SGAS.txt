Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 069 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Mar 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active.  Solar wind speed at ACE remained elevated
between 650 km/s and 750 km/s during the reporting period.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
