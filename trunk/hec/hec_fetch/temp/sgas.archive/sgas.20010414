None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 0850 UTC on 10 April ended today at 1405 UTC. The maximum for the
event was 355 PFU at 11/2055 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic activity ranged from
quiet to major storm levels during the past 24 hours, with one
period of severe storm activity at high latitudes from 0900-1200
UTC. A sudden impulse was observed at 0735 UTC.
