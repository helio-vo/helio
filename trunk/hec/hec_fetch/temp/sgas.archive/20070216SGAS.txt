SGAS Number 047 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Feb 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Feb
A.  Energetic Events

None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm conditions. An isolated minor storm period was
observed at middle latitudes between 15/0300 - 0600 UTC. Solar wind
speed at ACE continues to be elevated around 620 km/s.
