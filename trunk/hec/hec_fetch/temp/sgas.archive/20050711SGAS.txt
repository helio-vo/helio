B.  Proton Events:  There was a proton enhancement in the greater
than 10 MeV protons associated with the M2.8 flare on 09 July;
however, proton levels remained under event thresholds.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to major storm levels.  A transient shock from the CME
activity on 07 July was observed by ACE at approximately 10/0300
UTC.  Following the shock, there was a period of sustained southward
Bz resulting in major storming in the period from 1200 to 1500 UTC.
