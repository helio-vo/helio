Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 084 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Mar 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly quiet to unsettled levels.  An isolated active period
was observed at high latitudes between 24/0600 and 0900Z.  The
greater than 2 electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit reached high
levels again today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
