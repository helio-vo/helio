Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 363 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
unsettled to active at all latitudes. A high speed stream,
associated with a large equatorial coronal hole, began late on 26
Dec and continues to buffet the magnetic field. The peak solar wind
in this high speed stream exceeded 750 km/s, but has declined slowly
to near 650 km/s by the end of the period. The greater than 2 MeV
electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/SATURDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.  INTENSE
WARMING IN THE THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE OVE THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND
EUROPE WITH MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES OF PLUS 40 C AT 2 HPA.  REVERSED
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE NORTH POLE AND 60N AT 1 HPA AND
EXPECTED TO EXTEND FROM 10 TO 1 HPA WITHIN THE NEXT 5 DAYS.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
