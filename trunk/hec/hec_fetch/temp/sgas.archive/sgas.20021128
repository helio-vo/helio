B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels.  Predominantly active conditions persisted
for first half of the day, in the wake of a geomagnetic storm
commencement late yesterday.  Mainly unsettled and isolated quiet
conditions were observed for the last half of the day.
