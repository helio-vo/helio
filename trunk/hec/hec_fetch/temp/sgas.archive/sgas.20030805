Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 217 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Aug 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Aug

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Solar wind speed continues to show a steady decline as the
large southern coronal hole rotates out of a geoeffective position.
Occasional periods of southward Bz account for the active levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
