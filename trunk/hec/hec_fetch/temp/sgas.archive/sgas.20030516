Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 136 Issued at 0245Z on 16 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
unsettled to minor storm levels due to a favorably positioned
coronal hole.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

F.  Comments:  The GOES 10 energetic proton detectors are showing
intermittent, high noise levels in the higher energy proton channels
(greater than about 80 MeV). This problem was first noticed in data
taken April 26, 2003. To ensure continued operational monitoring of
important energetic particle data, it is necessary to reassign
primary/secondary designations for the GOES Space Environment
Monitor (SEM) detectors. As of 1500 UT on May 15, GOES-8 became the
primary satellite for protons. GOES 12 will be the primary satellite
for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements. GOES 10 will be
the secondary satellite for all SEM sensors - magnetometer, X-ray
sensor, and energetic particle sensor. This short-term solution
(approximately 2 - 3 months) will be in place until we define and
implement a permanent fix. A more detailed explanation can be found
