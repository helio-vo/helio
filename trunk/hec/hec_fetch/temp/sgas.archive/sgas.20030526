Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 146 Issued at 0245Z on 26 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  An oscillating Bz component of the
interplanetary magnetic field allowed for two consecutive periods of
minor storm conditions at both the middle and high latitudes during
local nighttime hours.  Elevated conditions are due to a high speed
stream coronal hole.  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
