Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 049 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Feb 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity was at
quiet to active levels. Activity increased to unsettled to active
levels during 17/0300 - 0900 UTC following a sudden impulse at
17/0257 UTC (13 nT, as measured by the Boulder USGS magnetometer).
Activity decreased to quiet to unsettled levels after 17/0900 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists Stratwarm Saturday
Intensifying warming over the Canadian arctic and northern Asia,
penetrating downwards. Temperature gradient reversed between 60 N
and the pole from 50 HPA upward.
