B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Solar wind speed is in gradual decline as a large
transequatorial coronal hole rotates out of a geoeffective position.
Solar wind speed decreased to near 500 km/s, but periods of
southward Bz generated occasional active levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
