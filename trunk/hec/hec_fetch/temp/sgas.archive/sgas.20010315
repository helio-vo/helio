B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  stratwarm alert/wednesday/stratwarm exists.
as a result of the major warming the circulation
in the lower stratosphere remains further disturbed
leading to a reversed temperature gradient up to
20 hpa.
in the middle and upper stratosphere the cold and
elongated vortex weakens.
slow transitions to summer conditions most probable.
