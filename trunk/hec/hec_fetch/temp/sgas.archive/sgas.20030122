B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  A lingering southern coronal hole extension is
believed to be responsible for the elevated conditions.  The greater
than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels
today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/TUESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
DECAYING WARMING, BUT STILL DISTURBED POLAR VORTEX THROUGHOUT THE
STRATOSPHERE. REVERSED TERMERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE
FROM 50 TO 10 HPA.
