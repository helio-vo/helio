Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 128 Issued at 0245Z on 08 May 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels. The disturbed conditions were
associated with a high speed coronal hole stream. Solar wind speed
gradually increased to over 600 km/s following the onset of the high
speed stream midday on 06 May.
