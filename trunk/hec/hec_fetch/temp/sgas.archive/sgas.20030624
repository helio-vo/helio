Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 175 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Jun 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1653 1653 1653                       1400                          
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active with an isolated minor storm period between
23/03-06Z. The field was disturbed due to a high speed coronal hole
stream which peaked near 600 km/s very early in the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 114  SSN 104  Afr/Ap 022/020   X-ray Background B1.9
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 3.1e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.2e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W113 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.40e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 5 4 4 3 3 3 3 Planetary 4 5 4 4 3 3 3 3 
F.  Comments: 
The scaling problem with the Boulder magnetometer instrument has been fixed and the instrument has been redesignated as the primary instrument for Boulder K-indices.  

GOES Protons:
To ensure continued operational monitoring of important energetic particle data, it is necessary to reassign primary/secondary designations for the GOES Space Environment Monitor (SEM) detectors. GOES 11 (113W) is now the primary satellite for protons. GOES 12 will continue as the primary satellite for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements. GOES 10 (135W) will be the secondary satellite for all SEM sensors - magnetometer, X-ray, and energetic particles.  Because of the degraded state of the proton data on GOES-10, its designation as the secondary source for proton data is a short-term solution.  More permanent solutions have been identified and are being evaluated.  Users will be notified when we define and schedule a permanent fix.  Further details can be found at http://www.sec.noaa.gov/GOES.html.

The problem with missing particle fluence data and X-ray background value has been corrected. Those missing values can now be found at:
