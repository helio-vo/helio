B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled except for one active period at high latitudes.  The solar
wind continued to exhibit characteristics of a high speed stream.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached
high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
