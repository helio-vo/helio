Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 072 Issued at 0245Z on 13 Mar 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Quiet to unsettled with an
isolated active period during 12/1500 - 1800 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists Monday
As a result of the major warming, the circulation in the lower
stratosphere remains further disturbed leading to a reversed
temperature gradient up to 20 hpa. In the middle and upper
stratosphere, the cold and elongated polar vortex weakens. Slow
transition to summer conditions most probable.
