B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux was on the
rise at the time of this writing (1.4 pfu at geosynchronous orvit)
in response to the M2.7/2n flare that occurred at 19/2153 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  A favorably positioned recurrent
coronal hole and the resulting high speed stream are responsible for
the elevated conditions.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
