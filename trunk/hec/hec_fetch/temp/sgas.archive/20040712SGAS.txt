Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 194 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Jul 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
minor storm. ACE solar wind data suggests the influence of a coronal
hole high-speed stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 5.9e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.5e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W96 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.30e+06 e/(cm2-ster-day)

F.  Comments:  The Afr index reported in Part E was estimated from
Boulder observations.
