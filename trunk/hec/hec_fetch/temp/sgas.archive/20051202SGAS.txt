Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 336 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Dec 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  The elevated conditions are due to a
recurrent high speed coronal hole stream.  The solar wind speed has
ranged between 650 and 750 km/sec throughout most of the period.
