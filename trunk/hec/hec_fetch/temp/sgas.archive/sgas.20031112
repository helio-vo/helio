Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 316 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Nov 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
active to severe storm levels. A single K=7 period was observed at
Boulder from 11/0300-0600 UTC. Solar wind conditions of high speed
(700-800 km/s) and low density (about 2 p/cc) suggest that the
expected coronal hole high-speed stream has arrived.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

F.  Comments:  The Afr index reported in part E is estimated from
Boulder, CO observations.
