Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 134 Issued at 0245Z on 14 May 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1613 1657 1728  0759 N12E12 M8.0  2b 420    2900   II/IV           
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.4e+06   GT 10 MeV 2.7e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W114 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.40e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W76 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 5 5 5 2 3 4 3 3 Planetary 5 5 5 3 3 4 3 2 
F.  Comments:  The Afr index reported in Part E is estimated from
Boulder observations. The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was moderate.
