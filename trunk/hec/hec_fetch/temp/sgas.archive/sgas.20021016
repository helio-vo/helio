Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 289 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Oct 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  A slow, yet steady, increase in the solar wind
speed along with intermittent periods of southward Bz allowed for
the active periods seen today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 177  SSN 165  Afr/Ap 014/015   X-ray Background C1.9
