Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 101 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Apr 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storming. The interplanetary shock associated with
the 6 April CME impacted the ACE spacecraft at 09/0147Z. Solar wind
speed increased from 450 km/s to near 570 km/s, and the IMF Bz
component turned southward for some short periods following the
shock arrival. The storm was short-lived with active to minor storm
levels ending by 09/0900Z.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
