JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 123 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 03 MAY 1999
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 02 MAY
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
NONE
B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO
ACTIVE, WITH THE MOST DISTURBED TIMES RELATED TO NIGHTTIME
SUBSTORMS. THE SOLAR WIND SPEED AT ACE IS STILL ABOVE 500 KM/S,
INDICATIVE OF THE HIGH SPEED STREAM AFFECTING THE MAGNETOSPHERE FOR
THE LAST FEW DAYS. THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV ELECTRONS AT
GEOSYNCHRONOUS WERE AGAIN HIGH, PASSING THAT THRESHOLD AT ABOUT
02/0900Z.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE
E.  DAILY INDICES: (REAL-TIME PRELIMINARY/ESTIMATED VALUES)
10 CM 136  SSN 136  AFR/AP 010/013   X-RAY BACKGROUND B4.3
DAILY PROTON FLUENCE (FLUX ACCUMULATION OVER 24 HRS)
GT 1 MEV 3.1E+05   GT 10 MEV 1.4E+04 P/(CM2-STER-DAY)
(GOES-8 SATELLITE SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT W75 DEGREES)
DAILY ELECTRON FLUENCE
GT 2 MEV 3.30E+08 E/(CM2-STER-DAY)
(GOES-8 SATELLITE SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT W75 DEGREES)
