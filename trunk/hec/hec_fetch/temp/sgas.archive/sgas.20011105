B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 100 MeV proton event began at 1650
UTC and continues in progress. The maximum flux so far is 56 pfu at
2035 UTC. A greater than 10 MeV proton event began at 1705 UTC and
also continues in progress. The maximum flux observed on 05 November
was 1850 pfu at 2355 UTC. 10 MeV flux levels were continuing to 
increase at the end of the day.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
