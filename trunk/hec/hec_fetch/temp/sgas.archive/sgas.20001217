Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 352 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Dec 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet with one isolated unsettled period in the higher latitudes
from 16/1500 - 1800Z.  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit attained high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM SATURDAY
STRONG STRATOSPHERIC WARMING IN PROGRESS.
A SPLIT VORTEX WITH A MAJOR CENTER OVER CANADA AND A
SECONDARY CENTER OVER RUSSIA; AN ANTICYCLONE OVER THE
PACIFIC AND AN EVOLVING ANTICYCLONE OVER THE NORTH
ATLANTIC.  COLD AIR CENTERED OVER NORTHERN CANADA; A WARM
REGION OVER CENTRAL ASIA, WEAKENING; A NEW WEAK COLD
CENTER OVER NORTH EASTERN EUROPE; A WARM REGION
DEVELOPING OVER EASTERN CANADA TOWARDS THE NORTH ATLANTIC.
