Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 120 Issued at 0245Z on 30 Apr 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 29 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels today.  Active periods began late in the period due
to a solar sector boundary crossing and a sustained southward Bz.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
