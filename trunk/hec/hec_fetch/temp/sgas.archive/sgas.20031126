Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 330 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Nov 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Nov
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active periods. The disturbed periods are
due to a moderate high speed solar wind stream from a well
positioned coronal hole. The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels again today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
