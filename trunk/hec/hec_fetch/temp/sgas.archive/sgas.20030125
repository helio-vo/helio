Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 025 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Jan 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Jan

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  The effects from a geo-effective coronal hole
continued today and produced an isolated active condition early in
the period.  Solar wind velocity increased to near 800 km/s around
24/1400 UTC.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geo-synchronous orbit exceeded event threshold today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/FRIDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS
STILL DISTURBED STRATOSPHERE.  REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN
60N AND THE POLE AT 5 HPA.
