B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
active to severe storm conditions.  An extended period of sustained
southward Bz followed the shock observed at ACE early on 19 Mar. The
geomagnetic storm was still in progress through the end of the
period, but was showing signs of weakening. This disturbance is
believed to be associated with the CME observed early on 16 Mar.
