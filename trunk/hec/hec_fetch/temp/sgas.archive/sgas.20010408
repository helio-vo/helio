Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 098 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Apr 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  Proton fluxes for particles with energy > 10 MeV
remained enhanced through the day but never exceeded the threshold
to call an event.  No significant increases have been observed
following the X5 flare on 01/1910 UT.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic activity ranged from
quiet to unsettled levels through the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
