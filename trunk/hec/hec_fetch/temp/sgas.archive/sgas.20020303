B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet, with some isolated unsettled periods during 02/1500-2100 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM SATURDAY
Throughout the stratosphere, disturbed circulation pattern with the
warm air over the polar region and eastern Asia and a displaced
vortex over northern Siberia, leading to a reversed temperature
gradient between 60N and the pole from 100 to 2hpa and weak mean
zonal easterly winds at 60N at 3 and 2hpa.
