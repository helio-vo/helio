Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 025 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Jan 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  The elevated conditions were due to a favorably
positioned high speed coronal hole stream, which has been waning
over the later part of the period.  Wind speed was nearing 400
km/sec at the time of this writing.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
