Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 041 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Feb 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Feb

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active with an isolated minor storm period between O600Z and 0900Z. 
This elevated activity was due to persistence of a coronal hole high
speed stream.  Solar wind speed at ACE fluctuated around 700 to 750
km/s throughout the period.  Bz was oscillating between +/- 5 nT.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
