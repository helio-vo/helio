Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 105 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Apr 2010
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
mostly quiet levels with an isolated period at minor storm levels
from 2100-2400z, due to the arrival of a coronal hole high-speed
stream.
