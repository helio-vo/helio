Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 156 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Jun 2013
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0331      0626                                        IV           
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels as coronal hole high speed strem effects
subside.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 110  SSN 059  Afr/Ap 010/010   X-ray Background B2.7
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 9.8e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.30e+09 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 Planetary 3 3 3 2 1 2 2 3 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit reached very high levels during the period.
Particle measurements are being reported from the GOES-15 spacecraft
due to a GOES-13 outage.
