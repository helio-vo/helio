Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 018 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Jan 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Jan
A.  Energetic Events

 0310 0321 0332  0720        M2.6

B.  Proton Events:  The proton event at greater than 10 MeV that
began on 16/0210 UTC remains in progress. The  X3 flare which
occurred at 17/0952 UTC has increased the current peak flux to 5040
pfu observed at 17/1750 UTC. A proton event at greater than 100 MeV
also resulted from the X3 flare, beginning at 17/1215 UTC and with a
current peak flux of 28 pfu observed at 17/1700 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to severe storm levels. Solar wind conditions observed by
the NASA ACE spacecraft show a fairly complex onset of activity
which may suggest the arrival of a solar wind structure from
combined CMEs expected from previous major flares on 15 January.
D.  Stratwarm:  None

F.  Comments:  The Afr index reported in Part E is estimated from
Boulder observations.
