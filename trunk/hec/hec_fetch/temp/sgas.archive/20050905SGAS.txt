Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 248 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Sep 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to minor storm levels.  Minor storming occurred between
0600 - 1200 UTC as Bz fluctuated between +/- 5 nT and the solar wind
speed increased from about 550 km/s to 750 km/s.  At time of issue,
solar wind speed was about 625 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 075  SSN 012  Afr/Ap 017/026   X-ray Background A3.2
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 3.2e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.5e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W113 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 4.30e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 4 4 5 5 3 3 3 3 Planetary 4 4 5 5 3 3 2 3 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 Mev electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was moderate today.
