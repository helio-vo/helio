B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  An increase of 150 km/s in the solar wind speed
during the period is believed to be the result of a recurrent
coronal hole.  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels again today.
