Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 243 Issued at 0245Z on 31 Aug 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
active to minor storm levels with a single period of major storming
at 0600 UTC.  The interplanetary magnetic field continues to be
oriented southward, and the solar wind speeds continue to be
elevated well above 450 km/s.  During the storm period, wind speeds
were near 650 km/s.  There is some evidence in the energetic protons
measured at the L1 orbit  that a small interplanetary shock passed
at or near the major storming period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
