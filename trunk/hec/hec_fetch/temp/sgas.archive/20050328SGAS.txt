Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 087 Issued at 0245Z on 28 Mar 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 27 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active periods. Solar wind speed, which is
elevated due to a high speed coronal hole stream, is in decline. The
wind speed began the period near 640 km/s, but gradually weakened to
around 530 km/s.
