SGAS Number 330 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Nov 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Active periods were due to intervals of southward Bz in the
IMF. Solar wind speed at ACE declined from approximately 520 km/s to
440 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
