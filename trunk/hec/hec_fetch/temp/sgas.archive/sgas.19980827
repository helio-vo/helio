JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 240 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 28 AUG 1998
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 27 AUG
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
NONE
B.  PROTON EVENTS:  THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON FLUXES HAVE
REMAINED ABOVE EVENT THRESHOLDS THROUGHOUT 27 AUGUST.  THE GREATER
THAN 100 MEV PROTON EVENT WAS DECLARED OVER AT 26/2050 UT. 
ENERGETIC ELECTRONS FLUXES GREATER THAN 2 MEV, AS MEASURED BY THE
GOES SATELLITE AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT, HAD DECREASED TO ABOUT 10
PFU EARLY ON 27 AUG AFTER PREVIOUSLY REACHING NEAR THE SEC ALERT
THRESHOLD OF 1000 PFU ON PREVIOUS DAYS.  SINCE 27/0900 UT, THE
FLUXES HAVE BEEN INCREASING.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT
MAJOR STORM TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS.   MID-LATITUDE K-INDICES REACHED
7 AND 8 BETWEEN 27/0300 UT AND 27/1200 UT.   THE FORBUSH DECREASE
THAT BEGAN LATE ON 25 AUGUST CONTINUES, WITH NEUTRON MONITOR
COUNTING RATES FROM THULE DEPRESSED BY ABOUT 6 PERCENT TODAY.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE.
