B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to major storm levels.  Elevated solar wind speeds
continue to be over 600 km/s.  Periods of southward Bz combined with
the elevated wind speed has produce minor storming and one period of
major storm levels.
