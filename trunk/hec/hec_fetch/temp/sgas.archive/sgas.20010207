Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 038 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Feb 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  Available solar wind data suggest that active and unsettled
periods observed today resulted from evolving conditions related to
onset of coronal hole high speed stream effects.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM TUESDAY
CRITERIA FOR A MAJOR WARMING WILL BE FULLFILLED WITHIN THE NEXT 5
DAYS. POLAR VORTEX WILL SPLIT WITH CENTERS SOUTH OF ICELAND AND WEST
SIBERIA, RESPECTIVELY. STRONG ALEUTIAN HIGH STAYS POLEWARDS OF
ALASKA.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
