Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 350 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Dec 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Dec
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet
throughout the day.  Greater-than-2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit was at moderate levels (above 1000 pfu) during
local dawn and daytime hours.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM THURSDAY
STRONG STRATOSPHERIC WARMING IN PROGRESS.  THE VORTEX CENTER AND COLD
AIR ARE LOCATED OVER CANADA WITH THE VORTEX BEING ELONGATED TOWARDS
THE BARENTS SEA.  THE PACIFIC ANTICYCLONE WEAKENS AND AN ANTICYCLONE
DEVELOPS OVER THE EASTERN ATLANTIC.  THE WARM AIR IS CENTERED OVER
CENTRAL ASIA.
