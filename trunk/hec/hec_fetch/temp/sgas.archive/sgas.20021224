Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 358 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  Sustained southward Bz and a
six-hour period of elevated solar wind velocity (peak velocity 600
km/s) resulted in active conditions at mid-latitudes and minor storm
conditions on the planetary index.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
