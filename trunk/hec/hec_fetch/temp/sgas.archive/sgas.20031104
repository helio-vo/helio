B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 02/1105Z has thus far had a maximum of 1570 pfu, which occurred
at 03/0815Z and has recently been ranging between 400 and 800 pfu's
at the time of this writing.  The greater than 100 MeV proton event
began at 02/1740Z, reached a maximum of 49 pfu at 02/1905Z, and
ended at 03/1720Z.  The polar cap absorption event remains in
progress.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.
