B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS
PREDOMINANTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED. THE PLANETARY K-INDEX REACHED
ACTIVE LEVEL IN THE 03/1500-1800Z INTERVAL. SOLAR WIND VELOCITY
DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 100 KM/S DURING THE PERIOD AND BZ WAS
NORTHWARD FOR ALMOST ALL THE PERIOD. ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES AT
GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT BECAME MODERATE.
D.  STRATWARM:  STRATWARM ALERT/WEDNESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
FINAL WARMING CONTINUES.
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT REVERSED BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE
THROUGHOUT THE STRATOSPHERE.MEAN ZONAL WIND AT 60N CON-
TINUOUSLY WEAKENING IN THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE AND HAS
REACHED EASTERLY DIRECTION IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRA-
TOSPHERE.
