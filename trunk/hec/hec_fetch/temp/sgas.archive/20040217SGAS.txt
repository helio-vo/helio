Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 048 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Feb 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Feb

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. The high speed coronal hole stream that produced the
minor disturbance over the past several days has declined
considerably. Solar wind speed peaked yesterday near 800 km/s, but
 gradually decreased to 500 km/s by the
end of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 099  SSN 081  Afr/Ap 006/007   X-ray Background A9.0
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.2e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.3e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W101 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.30e+09 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was at very high levels.
