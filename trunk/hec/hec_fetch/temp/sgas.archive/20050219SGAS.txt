Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 050 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Feb 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Feb

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  Activity was due to the effects of a high
speed stream from a geoeffective coronal hole.  Solar wind speed at
ACE showed an increase to approximately 600 km/s by 18/1600Z and
then decreased slightly to 550 km/s by the end of the period.
