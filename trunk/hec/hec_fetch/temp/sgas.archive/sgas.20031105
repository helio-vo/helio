B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit have been on a steady decrease through the
period and continue above alert levels; the event began at 02/1105Z,
and had a maximum of 1570 pfu's which was observed at 03/0815Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to severe storm levels.  A shock passage occurred at the ACE
satellite at approximately 04/0600Z due to the CME from the  X8
event on 02 Nov.  A sudden impulse of 72 nT was observed by the
Boulder magnetometer at 04/0627Z.
