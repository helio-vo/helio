Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 209 Issued at 0245Z on 28 Jul 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 27 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  A recurrent high speed coronal
hole stream and a sustained southward Bz are believed responsible
for the elevated activity.  The solar wind speed exceeded 800 km/s
at approximately 27/0600Z
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
