Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 286 Issued at 0245Z on 13 Oct 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 Oct

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mainly
quiet to unsettled, with one active period observed during
12/0900-2100 UTC.  Greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit briefly reached high levels and exceeded event
threshold today.
