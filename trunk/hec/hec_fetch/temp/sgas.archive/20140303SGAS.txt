B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux remained
elevated and reached a maximum daily value of 30 pfu at 02/0030 UTC.
Proton flux values continued to steadily decrease as they
recover
from the proton event which began at 25/1355 UTC from an
X4/2b.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
