Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 061 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Mar 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active periods at high latitudes. A high
speed coronal hole stream continues to buffet the geomagnetic field.
Solar wind speed ranged from 600 - 700 km/s, but the IMF Bz was
predominantly northward.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
