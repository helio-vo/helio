Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 093 Issued at 0245Z on 03 Apr 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 02 Apr
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  High speed stream effects from a favorably positioned
coronal hole continued, but showed signs of a gradual waning trend
throughout the day.
