Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 279 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Oct 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Oct
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels with major storm conditions at high
latitudes.  Storming conditions are the result of the passage of a
magnetic cloud.  Data from the ACE spacecraft showed a smooth
rotation of Bz to strong negative values starting at approximately
04/0000Z.  The Bz remained negative for the rest of the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
