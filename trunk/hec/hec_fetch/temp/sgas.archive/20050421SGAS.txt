Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 111 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Apr 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  Heightened activity was due to a solar
sector boundary followed by the onset of a coronal hole high speed
stream.  Solar wind speed at ACE increased from approximately 450
km/s to 600 km/s.  By the end of the period, solar wind speed had
decreased to approximately 450 km/s.
