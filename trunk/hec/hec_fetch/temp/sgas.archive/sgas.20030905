Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 248 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Sep 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active. This weak disturbance is due to a high speed
coronal hole stream. Solar wind speeds began the period slightly
elevated near 500 km/s, but gradually increased to 650 - 700 km/s by
the latter half of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
