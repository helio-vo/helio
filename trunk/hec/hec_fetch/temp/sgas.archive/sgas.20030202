Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 033 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Feb
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels during the past 24 hours. Quiet conditions
prevailed for most of the day, but an increase to unsettled to
active began at 1500 UTC. A marked increase in solar wind velocity
and total magnetic field strength was observed beginning at 1300
UTC, but a predominantly positive value for Bz suppressed activity
until 1900 UTC, when Bz turned weakly southwards. The interpretation
of the enhanced solar wind flow is not obvious, but seems most
consistent with the passage of transient flow due to the halo CME
that occurred on 30 January. The great than 2 MeV electron fluxes
reached high levels during the past 24 hours.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/SATURDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS
STILL DISTURBED TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER
STRATOSPHERE WITH A WARM REGION OVER NORTHEASTERN EUROPE/NORTHERN
SIBERIA, LEADING TO A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND
THE POLE AT 2 TO 1 HPA.
