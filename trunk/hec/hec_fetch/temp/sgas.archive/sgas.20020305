Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 064 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Mar 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Mar

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  The onset of high speed stream effects from a large,
recurrent coronal hole was apparent over the course of the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM MONDAY
Throughout the stratosphere still disturbed circulation pattern with
warm air over Asia and the polar region and a displaced vortex over
northern Siberia, leading to a reversed temperature between the pole
and 60N from 50 to 3 HPa and a 1 HPa.
