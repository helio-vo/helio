Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 018 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Jan 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/FRIDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS
STRONG WARMING CONTINUES OVER THE SIBERIAN ARCTIC AND NORTHERN EUROPE
LEADING TO A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE
FROM 30 HPA UPWARDS AND EASTERLY WINDS AT 60N FROM 5 TO 1 HPA. 
WITHIN THE NEXT TWO DAYS, THE FORECAST INDICATES A SPLITTING OF THE
POLAR VORTEX THROUGHOUT THE STRATOSPHERE WITH EASTERLY WINDS AT 60N
DOWN TO 10 HPA.
