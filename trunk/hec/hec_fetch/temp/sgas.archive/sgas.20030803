B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  The high-speed stream associated
with a significant coronal hole has been steady at approximately 720
km/s, making the geomagnetic field susceptible to variations in the
interplanetary magnetic field.
