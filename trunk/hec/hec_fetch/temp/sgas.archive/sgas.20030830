Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet to minor storm levels.  Two periods of minor storming occurred
one at 1200 and another at 1700 UTC.  The solar wind speeds continue
to be elevated above 450 km/s, reaching over 600 km/s toward the end
of the period.  This combined with a sustained southward
interplanetary magnetic field polarity have kept the geomagnetic
field elevated.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
