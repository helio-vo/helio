Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 062 Issued at 0245Z on 03 Mar 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 02 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
unsettled, becoming quiet late in the UTC day.  A high speed coronal
hole stream remains geoeffective.  Solar wind speed ranged from 600
- 700 km/s; however, a downward trend was observed through the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
