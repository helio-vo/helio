Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 250 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Sep 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 083  SSN 012  Afr/Ap 007/009   X-ray Background B3.4
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.2e+06   GT 10 MeV 2.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W113 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.30e+09 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was at very high levels again today. A very
long duration M1 flare and assocted CME was in progress off the
southeast limb at the time of this issue.
