B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.  A weak shock, due to activity on 30 August, was observed
at the L1 position by the NASA/ACE spacecraft at 03/1710 UTC.  
Solar wind velocity reached a peak around 390 km/s and the IMF had a
Bz deflection of 10 nT.  Current Bz is approximately -8 nT.
