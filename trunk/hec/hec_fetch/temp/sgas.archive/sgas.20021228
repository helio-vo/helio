Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 362 Issued at 0245Z on 28 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 27 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels with isolated major storm periods at
higher latitudes. These storm conditions are a result of a large
coronal hole that rotated into a geoeffective position late
yesterday. Solar wind speed ranged 700 - 800 km/s during the latter
half of this period.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/FRIDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.  INTENSE
WARMING IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE OVER THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND EUROPE
WITH MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES OF PLUS 48 C AT 2 HPA.  REVERSED
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE NORTH POLE AND 60N EXPECTED WITHIN
THE NEXT 5 DAYS.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 117  SSN 063  Afr/Ap 026/037   X-ray Background B2.7
