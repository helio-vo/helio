Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 297 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Oct 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
levels through 22/0900UT, and at unsettled to active levels
thereafter, with the onset of coronal hole high speed stream
effects.  Greater-than-2 MeV electrons at geosynchronous orbit
exhibited a brief, midday enhancement to moderate levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
