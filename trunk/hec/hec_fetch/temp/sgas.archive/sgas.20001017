B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event at
geosynchronous orbit began at 16/1125 UTC. The preliminary peak flux
was 15.1 PFU at 16/1840 UTC. The event was nearing its end at the
close of the period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Field activity was at active
levels until 16/0300 UTC, then decreased to quiet to unsettled
levels.
