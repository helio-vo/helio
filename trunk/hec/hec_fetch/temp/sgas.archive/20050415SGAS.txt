Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 105 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Apr 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  Elevated levels are due to a geoeffective
high speed coronal hole stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
