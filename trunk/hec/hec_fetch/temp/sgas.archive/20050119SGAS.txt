B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event remains in
progress with a start time of 16/0210 UTC and a peak flux of 5040
pfu observed at 17/1750 UTC. The greater than 100 MeV proton event
appears to have ended with a start time of 17/1215 UTC, 28 pfu peak
flux observed at 17/1700 UTC, and tentative end at 18/2205 UTC. GOES
spacecraft electron sensors and ACE SWEPAM instruments remain
affected by the energetic proton event.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
active to severe storm levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
