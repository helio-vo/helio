Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 218 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Aug 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1243 1249 1251  0424 S16E33 M1.7  Sn        40     II              
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic activity has been
quiet to active.  Solar wind speeds have steadily decreased through
the period, as a coronal hole has rotated out of geoeffective
position.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
