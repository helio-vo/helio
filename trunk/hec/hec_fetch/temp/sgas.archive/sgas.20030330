Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 089 Issued at 0245Z on 30 Mar 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 29 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1831 1839 1846  0318 S13W21 C8.2  1f 170    25                     
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels. A pronounced transient flow with
sustained  periods of southward Bz in the interplanetary magnetic
field, produced the disturbed periods. Solar wind speed decreased to
less than 400 km/s by end of period, but continued southward Bz is
prolonging the disturbance.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
