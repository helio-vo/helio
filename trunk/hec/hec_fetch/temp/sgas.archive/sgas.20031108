Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 312 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Nov 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 02/1105Z and reached a peak value of 1570 pfu on 03/0815Z, ended
today at 07/1230Z.  A small enhancement of greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was observed at around 07/1730Z but is currently below
threshold.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
