B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active levels late in the period. Extended
periods of southward IMF were observed this period, but the
potential impact on the geomagnetic field was offset by the very low
solar wind speeds (260 -320 km/s).
