B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 100 MeV proton event at
geosynchronous orbit that began at 13/1810Z has so far reached a
peak of 1.89 pfu and the event remains in progress.  The greater
than 10 MeV proton event that began at 13/1810Z has so far reached a
peak of 469 pfu and the event remains in progress as of the close of
the period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Field activity was mostly quiet to
unsettled in the mid latitudes with active periods at high
latitudes.
