Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 081 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Mar 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  A weak coronal hole high speed stream appears to
have passed the ACE spacecraft at approximately 21/0800 UTC with
maximum solar wind speeds reaching 650 km/s at approximately 20/0900
UTC.  Following two hours of a sustained southward Bz, a brief
geoeffective period of active conditions occurred between 20/1200
and 1500 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
