Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 219 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Aug 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to minor storm levels.  Minor storming was observed at
high latitudes between 06/0000 - 1200 UTC.  Solar wind data indicate
the onset of a coronal hole high speed stream beginning about
05/2200.  The solar wind speed remains elevated at approximately 650
km/s at time of issue.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
