JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 235 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 23 AUG 1998
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 22 AUG
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FILED WAS
PREDOMINANTLY QUIET EARLY IN THE PERIOD. A DISTURBANCE OCCURRED
BETWEEN 22/0600UT TO APPROXIMATELY 22/1300UT. ACTIVE TO MAJOR STORM
CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED DURING THAT TIME. SOME HIGH LATITUDE
SENSORS RECORDED PERIODS OF SEVERE STORMING. THE FIELD WAS UNSETTLED
TO SLIGHTLY ACTIVE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. SOLAR WIND DATA
DURING THE DISTURBANCE SHOWED A LOW SPEED. MODERATELY HIGH DENSITY
FLOW IN THE VICINITY OF THE EARTH. THESE SOLAR WIND CONDITIONS ARE
NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF CORONAL HOLE RELATED STREAMS. HOWEVER, AT THE
END OF THE PERIOD, SOLAR WIND VELOCITY WAS INCREASING AND DENSITY
DECREASING. THE GREATER THAT 10 MEV PROTON FLUXES HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY
ELEVATED ABOVE BACKGROUND BUT BELOW THRESHOLD SINCE EARLY ON 20 AUG.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE
