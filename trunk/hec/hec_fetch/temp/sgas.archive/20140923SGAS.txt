Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 266 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Sep 2014
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux was enhanced
due to flare activity from around the west limb but remained well
below alert threshold with a peak of 2 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
