B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux at
geosynchronous orbit was enhanced following the X1/2B flare at
27/1748 UTC, reaching a maximum flux of 3 pfu at 29/2230 UTC.  Flux
is returning to normal levels.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
