B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV and 100 MeV proton flux
levels remained enhanced from the M2 flare from behind the east limb
on 03 Sep. 10 MeV proton flux reached a maximum value of 8 pfu at
05/1900Z but did not reach alert threshold.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
