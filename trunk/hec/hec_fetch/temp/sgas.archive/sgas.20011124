SGAS Number 328 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Nov 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  Energetic proton flux at geosynchronous orbit
remained above event thresholds throughout the day, with maximum 100
MeV integral flux of 4 pfu observed at 23/0850 UTC, and maximum 10
MeV integral flux of 4800 pfu at 23/1400 UTC.  End of day flux
values were 3.5 pfu and 4200 pfu, respectively.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly quiet to unsettled.  A single active period was
observed at Boulder during 23/1200-1500 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
