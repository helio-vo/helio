JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 064 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 05 MAR 1999
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 04 MAR
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
 1926 1931 1937              C1.4     500                           
B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM
QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.  THE PLANETARY K-INDEX REACHED MINOR
STORM LEVELS IN THE 04/0600-0900Z INTERVAL.  SOLAR WIND VELOCITY
STEADILY ROSE FROM APPROXIMATELY 380 TO 600 KM/S DURING THE PERIOD. 
DENSITY REMAINED LOW, INDICATING THE AFFECTS OF A CORONAL HOLE
STREAM IMPACTING THE EARTH.  ENERGETIC ELECTRON FLUXES AT
GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT REACHED HIGH LEVELS FROM APPROXIMATELY 04/1920
- 2030Z, AND WERE PREDOMINANTLY MODERATE.
D.  STRATWARM:  STRATWARM ALERT/THURSDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
FINAL WARMING CONTINUES.
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT REVERSED BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE IN
THE LOWER AND MIDDLE STRATOSPHERE.MEAN ZONAL WIND AT 60N
CONTINUOUSLY WEAKENING IN THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE AND HAS
REACHED EASTERLY DIRECTION AT 30 HPA AND ABOVE IN THE MIDDLE
AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE.
