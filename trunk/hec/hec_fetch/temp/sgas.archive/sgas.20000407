JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 098 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 07 APR 2000
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 06 APR
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
 0218 0229 0238  8948 S15E53 M1.8  2B 42     220    II

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM
UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS.  A SHOCK WAS OBSERVED BY THE ACE
SPACECRAFT AROUND 06/1600UT.  THE ASSOCIATED SUDDEN IMPULSE WAS
OBSERVED AT  1640UT (37NT AS OBSERVED AT SAN JUAN) AND THE FIELD HAS
BEEN AT MAJOR STORM LEVELS SINCE THAT TIME.  THERE WERE MAGNETOPAUSE
CROSSINGS OBSERVED ON BOTH GOES 8 AND GOES 10 STARTING AROUND
1800UT.  THIS DISTURBANCE IS MOST LIKELY THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE HALO
CME OBSERVED FOLLOWING THE C9/2F FLARE AT 04/1541UT.  THE SATELLITE
PROTON EVENT WHICH BEGAN AT 04/2055UT, ENDED TODAY AT 0155UT.
