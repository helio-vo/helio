Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 314 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Nov 2013
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  A slight enhancement continued in the greater
than 10 MeV protons in association with the X1/2b flare on 08
November, however it remained below the 10 pfu threshold.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 148  SSN 095  Afr/Ap 014/022   X-ray Background B6.7
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.1e+06   GT 10 MeV 7.0e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-13 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 7.20e+05 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-13 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 2 4 4 4 5 3 2 1 Planetary 3 5 4 5 5 3 2 1 
F.  Comments:  Type IV radio sweep that began on 08 November
associated with the X1/2b flare continued through 09 November which
is the reason for the X-flare showing up on energetic events.
