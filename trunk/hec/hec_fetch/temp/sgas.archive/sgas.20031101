B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 100 MeV proton event in progress
since 28/1145Z, ended at 31/0145Z. This prolonged high energy proton
event was actually two distinct events associated with the X17 and
X10 flares on the 28th and 29th respectively. The peak measurements
for both events were 186 pfu at 29/0015Z and 110 pfu at 29/2310Z.
The greater than 10 MeV proton event remains in progress, but is
quickly declining to the 10 pfu alert threshold. The two peak
measurements at 10 MeV were 29,000 pfu at 29/0615Z and 3300 pfu at
30/1935Z. The PCA event has ended.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
active to severe storm levels. The intense geomagnetic storm that
began at around 30/1600Z, continued into the early stages of this
period. Severe storm levels persisted from 31/0000Z through
31/0900Z. Mostly active to major storm periods occurred through the
latter half of the period. Solar radiation contamination on the ACE
SWEPAM instrument finally ended at 31/0052Z. Solar wind speed was at
an exceptionally high 1200 km/s, but has been in a gradual decline,
ending the period at over 800 km/s. The prolonged periods of
southward IMF Bz that occurred early in the period have ended. Bz
has been mostly northward since 31/0200Z.
