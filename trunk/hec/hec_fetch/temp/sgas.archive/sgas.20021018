Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 291 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Oct 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field activity was
at quiet to active levels.  An isolated active period occurred
between 17/0000-0300 UTC at high latitudes.
