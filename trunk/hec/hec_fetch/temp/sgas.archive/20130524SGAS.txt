Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 144 Issued at 0245Z on 24 May 2013
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1525 1533 1549  1756 S20E37 C2.6  Sf 130

B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton flux greater than 10
pfu event continues.  The event began at 23/2330Z, reached a maximum
of 1660 pfu at 23/0650Z, fell below the 1000 pfu threshold at
23/1040Z and ended the day at 180 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 135  SSN 117  Afr/Ap 008/008   X-ray Background B6.5
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 2.3e+08   GT 10 MeV 6.9e+07 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 2.00e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 2 2 1 2 2 3 2 2 Planetary 2 3 0 2 2 2 2 2 
F.  Comments:  >2MeV electron data suspect because of proton
contamination.  GOES-15 particle data is being used because of a
GOES-13 outage.
