B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to active levels with an isolated quiet period from 0300
UTC to 0600 UTC.  The coronal hole induced high speed solar wind
stream continues.  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at
geo-synchronous orbit reached high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
