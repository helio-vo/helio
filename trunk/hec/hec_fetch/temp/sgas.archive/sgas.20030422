Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 112 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Apr 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Apr

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly unsettled to active levels with isolated high latitude
minor storm periods. A high speed solar wind stream, with winds
ranging from 520 - 600 km/s, continues to buffet the geomagnetic
field.
D.  Stratwarm:  None

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electrons at geosynchronous
orbit reached high levels.
