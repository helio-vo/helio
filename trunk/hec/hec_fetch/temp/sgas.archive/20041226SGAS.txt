Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 361 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Dec 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active with an isolated period of minor storming from 0300Z to 0600Z
on 25 December.  Active conditions due to the onset of a
geoeffective coronal hole high speed stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
