B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet to unsettled levels.  The coronal hole which influenced the
previous days' activity has moved out of geoeffective range.  The
greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at geostationary altitudes has
been at moderate levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
