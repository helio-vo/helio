Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 142 Issued at 0245Z on 22 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Periods of southward Bz near -10 nT resulted in
two active periods during the day.  Solar wind speed began a steady
increase, most likely due to the onset of an equatorial coronal hole
high speed flow.  Wind speed increased from 400 km/s to over 600
km/s and continues to rise.
