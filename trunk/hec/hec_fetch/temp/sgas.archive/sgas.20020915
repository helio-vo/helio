B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Coronal hole high speed stream effects subsided
near mid-period.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit exceeded event threshold at 14/1130 UTC and
remains at high levels.
