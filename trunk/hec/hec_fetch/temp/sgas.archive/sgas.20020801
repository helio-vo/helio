B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  A weak shock was detected at the L1 position
by the NASA/ACE spacecraft at approximately 31/1100 UTC.  The Bz
component of the IMF was northward resulting in little geomagnetic
activity.
