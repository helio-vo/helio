Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 060 Issued at 0245Z on 01 Mar 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active conditions late in the period. A
coronal hole high speed stream is in effect; however, the IMF Bz was
predominantly northward. Solar wind speed ranged from 550 - 600
km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
