Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 280 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Oct 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  A six-hour period of southward Bz (02Z to
08Z) was associated with a sector boundary crossing and resulted in
active to minor storm conditions (03Z to 09Z).  Greater than 2 MeV
electron flux at geo-synchronous orbit reached high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
