Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 311 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Nov 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event continues with
current flux levels at 16 pfu and slowly decreasing.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  The shock from the X28 flare on 04 November
reached Earth at 06/1937Z.  A 31nT sudden impulse was observed on
the Boulder magnetometer and activity reached minor storm levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
