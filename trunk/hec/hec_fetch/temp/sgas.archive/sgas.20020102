Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 002 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Jan 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Jan

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 30/0245 UTC remains in progress.  Event maximum was 108 pfu at
31/1620 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM TUESDAY
MAJOR WARMING CONTINUES.  WARM AIR COVERS MOST OF THE POLAR REGION IN
THE UPPER AND MIDDLE STRATOSPHERE.  THE TEMPERATURE GRADIENT ARE
REVERSED DOWN TO 50HPA, AND THERE ARE MEAN ZONAL EASTERLY WINDS AT
10HPA AND ABOVE AT 60N.
