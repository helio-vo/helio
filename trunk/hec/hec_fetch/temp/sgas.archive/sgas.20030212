Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 043 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with a single active period at mostly higher latitudes
between 11/0000 - 0300Z. Solar wind conditions, slightly elevated in
recent days, have declined to normal levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/TUESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE SLIGHTLY DISTURBED TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION WITH A WARM REGION OVER SIBERIA WHICH DEADS TO A
REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE FROM 5 TO 1
HPA.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 135  SSN 134  Afr/Ap 010/012   X-ray Background B3.1
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 8.2e+04   GT 10 MeV 1.4e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence

(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 3 3 2 2 1 3 2 Planetary 4 3 3 2 2 3 3 1 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit once again reached high levels.
