Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 199 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Jul 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Jul

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 14/0245Z, had a peak flux of 134 pfu at 15/0345Z, and underwent
an injection of flux at 17/1735Z allowing for the event to remain
in-progress at near 17 pfu at the time of this writing.  The source
believed responsible for the increase in proton flux was the
back-sided activity relating to the full halo CME first seen on
LASCO C2 imagery at 17/1130Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.  A weak transient signature (likely
from the X1 related CME activity seen on 14 July) was detected at
the ACE spacecraft near 17/0000Z where the wind speeds increased
from near 425 km/sec to 500 km/sec.
