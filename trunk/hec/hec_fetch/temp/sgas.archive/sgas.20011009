Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 282 Issued at 0245Z on 09 Oct 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 08 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0527 0534 0548              C1.3     130

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux at
geosynchronous orbit remained at elevated levels but below the
proton event threshold of 10 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels with isolated active periods between 08/1200 and
2400 UTC.  High speed stream effects are believed to be responsible
for the slightly elevated field levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
