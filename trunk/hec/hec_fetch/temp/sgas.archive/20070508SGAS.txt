Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 128 Issued at 0245Z on 08 May 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active with one period of minor storming.  Real-time solar
wind data are consistent with the onset of a coronal hole high speed
stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
