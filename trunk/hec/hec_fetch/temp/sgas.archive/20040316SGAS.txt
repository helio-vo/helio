Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 076 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Mar 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to active with an isolated minor storm period between 15/0000
- 0300Z. Solar wind speed is still slightly elevated, but is in slow
decline. The IMF Bz was predominantly southward near -5 nT.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
