This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 08 Apr

B.  Proton Events:  Proton fluxes > 10 MeV remained near event
thresholds until the middle of the day and then have declined
rapidly to near background levels.  The Thule Neutron Monitor has
shown a decreasing counting rate beginning about 08/1500 UT and
reaching down about five percent or more by 08/1800 UT.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic activity has ranged
from quiet to minor storm values.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
