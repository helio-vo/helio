Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 024 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Jan 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to minor storm levels.  An apparent transient signature
was observed to pass the ACE spacecraft at approximately 23/1400Z
which may be related to the filament eruption and related CME from
the southeastern solar quadrant early on 19 Jan.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
