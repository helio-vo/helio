Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 167 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Jun 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to major storm conditions. Major storm periods were observed between
15/0600 - 0900 UTC and 15/0900 - 1200 UTC. Activity was due to the
effects from a recurrent coronal hole high speed stream.
