B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  The ACE satellite indicated the passage of a
weak shock (presumed to be the result of the M1 flare at 07/0346
UTC) at approximately 09/0900 UTC.  The Bz energy channel remained
north and several periods of unsettled conditions persisted.
