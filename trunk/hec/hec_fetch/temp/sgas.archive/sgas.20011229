B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event which had
been in progress since 26 December ended today.  The event began at
26/0605 UTC, reached a maximum flux of 779 pfu at 26/1115 UTC, and
ended at 28/1040 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/FRIDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
STRONG STRATOSPHERIC WARMING, INTENSIFYING IN THE LOWER
STRATOSPHERE, WEAKENING IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE.
5-DAY FORECASTS INDICATE A SPLIT OF THE POLAR VORTEX
IN THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE, A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRA-
DIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE NORTH POLE FROM 50 TO 10 HPA,
NET EASTERLY WINDS AT 60N FROM 5 TO 2 HPA.
