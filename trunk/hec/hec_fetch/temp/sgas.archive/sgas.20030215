Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 046 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0907 0918 0923  0284 N13W86 M1.2  Sf                               
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Early in the period the solar wind speed began a
gradual increase to a current 500 km/s rise, this, along with
frequent periods of southward Bz allowed for the active conditions. 
The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit
reached moderate levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT / FRIDAY / STRATWARM EXISTS.
IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE, STILL SLIGHTLY DISTURBED
TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION WITH A WARM REGION OVER SIBERIA LEADING TO
A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE AT 10 AND 1
