F.  Comments:  At 1400UT, June 22, the SEC secondary GOES satellite
for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements will change from
GOES 10 to GOES 11. GOES 12 will continue as the primary SEC GOES
satellite. For energetic proton measurements there is no change;
GOES 11 will remain the primary SEC GOES satellite and GOES 10 will
remain the secondary. This change is necessary because NOAA will be
activating GOES 11 as the operational satellite stationed at 135
degrees West geographic longitude in geosynchronous orbit, replacing
the aging GOES 10. For additional information see:
