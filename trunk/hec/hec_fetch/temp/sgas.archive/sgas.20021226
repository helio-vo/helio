Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 360 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly at unsettled levels.  One period of isolated active
conditions occurred.  Solar wind velocity gradually decreased
throughout the day from 540 km/s to 440 km/s and Bz was slightly
negative for most of the day.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux
at geo-synchronous orbit reached high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
