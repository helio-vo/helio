Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 158 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Jun 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels. A large recurrent coronal hole is
rotating into a geoeffective position. Solar wind speed was at 600
km/s by the end of the period.
