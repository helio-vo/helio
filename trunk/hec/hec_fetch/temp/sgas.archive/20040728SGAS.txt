B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 25/1855Z is still in progress. A rapid, short-lived increase in
the greater than 10 MeV protons to 2,090 pfu occurred with the shock
passage at 25/2250Z. Protons quickly declined and were straddling
the 10 pfu alert threshold by the end of the period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
active to severe storming. A strong sudden impulse (SI) of 95 nT
was observed on the Boulder magnetometer at 26/2228Z. This SI
followed the very fast (~31 hours) transit of the full halo CME
associated with the long duration M1 flare on 25/1514Z. Solar wind
speed increased from the already elevated levels near 600 km/s to
over 1050 km/s. After approximately four hours of fluctuating
between  -15 and +15 nT, the IMF Bz rotated strong southward and
ranged from -15 to -25 nT for about 15 hours. The fast solar wind
speed and southward Bz combined to produce severe geomagnetic storm
levels at all latitudes from 27/0000Z to 27/1500Z. Solar wind speed
was still near 900 km/s by the end of the period but Bz was near
zero. The disturbance declined to minor storm levels to end the
period.
