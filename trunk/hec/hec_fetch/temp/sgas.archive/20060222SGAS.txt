Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 053 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Feb 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  The elevated conditions are due to a favorably
positioned transequatorial coronal hole high speed stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
