Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 119 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Apr 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Apr
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  A very weak signature from the NASA/ACE data
indicate a transient may have passed around 28/1200Z although the
elevated geomagnetic conditions are believed to be from a recurrent
coronal hole.  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit have again reached high levels.
