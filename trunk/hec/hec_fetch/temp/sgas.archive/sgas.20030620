Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 171 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Jun 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Jun

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux exceeded
event  threshold at 18/2050Z (reached a max of 24 pfu at 19/0450Z),
ended at 19/1900Z and after careful review the event is believed to
have been the result of the M6.8 x-ray flare from June 17.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly active levels today.  Minor storm conditions were
observed at both middle and high latitudes between 19/0000 and 0300Z
due to the influence of a recurrent high speed coronal hole stream. 
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached moderate levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None

K-Indices:
On 16 June, it was determined that a scaling problem exists with the Boulder magnetometer instrument.  While this problem, and its fix are being investigated the primary instrument for Boulder K-indices has been switched to the Boulder USGS (via Domsat) magnetometer, effective 1500 UTC on 16 June.  

GOES Protons:
To ensure continued operational monitoring of important energetic particle data, it is necessary to reassign primary/secondary designations for the GOES Space Environment Monitor (SEM) detectors. GOES 11 (113W) is now the primary satellite for protons. GOES 12 will continue as the primary satellite for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements. GOES 10 (135W) will be the secondary satellite for all SEM sensors - magnetometer, X-ray, and energetic particles.  Because of the degraded state of the proton data on GOES-10, its designation as the secondary source for proton data is a short-term solution.  More permanent solutions have been identified and are being evaluated.  Users will be notified when we define and schedule a permanent fix.
