Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 091 Issued at 0245Z on 01 Apr 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 31 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic ranged from quiet
to minor storm levels, with occasional major storm periods at high
latitudes. The high speed stream that began early on 30 March
continues. An extended period of southward Bz began at around 1100Z
and was responsible for the most disturbed periods.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ANERT/ MONDAY/ STRATWARM EXISTS.
A LARVE WARM REGION, CENTERED OVER NORTHERN SIBERIA, EXPANDS FURTHER
POLEWARDS WHILE THE COLD REGION WEAKENS, I.E. THE FINAL WARMING
PROGRESSES. THE VORTEX, HOWEVER, ONLY SLOWLY WEAKENS, INDICATING A
 LATE TRANSITION TO THE SUMMER CIRCULATION.
STRATWARM ALERTS MESSAGES WILL BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL 1 DECEMBER.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 160  SSN 165  Afr/Ap 026/031   X-ray Background B3.8
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 6.7e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 3.70e+07 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electrons at geosynchronous
orbit reached high levels.
