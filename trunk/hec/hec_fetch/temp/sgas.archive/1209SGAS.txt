None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 06/1555Z continues, but is on the decline.  The maximum observed
flux so far is 1980 pfu at 07/1930Z.  The greater than 100 MeV
proton event that began at 07/0115Z continues, but is also on the
decline.  The maximum observed flux so far is 19 pfu at 07/1610Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.
