JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 302 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 29 OCT 1999
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 28 OCT
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
 0028 0028 0031                       770

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD VARIED FROM
QUIET TO MINOR STORM LEVELS DURING THE DAY. ABOUT 1200Z, SOLAR WIND
PLASMA AND MAGNETIC FIELD EXPERIENCED A CHANGE AT THE ACE
SPACECRAFT, RESULTING IN THE DISTURBED LEVELS SEEN DURING THE LATTER
HALF OF THE PERIOD. THESE DATA SUGGEST A GLANCING BLOW BY A
TRANSIENT AS THE CAUSE OF THE ELEVATED ACTIVITY. THE GREATER THAN 2
MEV ELECTRON FLUX AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT REACHED HIGH LEVELS FROM
1330-1630Z, APPROXIMATELY.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE
E.  DAILY INDICES: (REAL-TIME PRELIMINARY/ESTIMATED VALUES)
