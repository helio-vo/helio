Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 319 Issued at 0245Z on 14 Nov 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 07/1910Z is nearing an end. The current proton flux is ranging
from 5 to 10 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated high latitude active periods. Solar wind
speed remains slightly elevated, ranging from 450 to 500 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
