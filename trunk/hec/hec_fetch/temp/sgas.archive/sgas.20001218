Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 353 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Dec 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Dec

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to unsettled with an isolated period of active conditions
observed during the 17/1500 - 1800Z period.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM SUNDAY
STRONG STRATOSPHERIC WARMING IS IN PROGRESS.
STRONG ELONGATED POLAR VORTEX WITH A MAJOR CENTER 
OVER NORTHERN CANADA AND A MINOR CENTER OVER RUSSIA
IS WEAKENING.  AN ANTICYCLONE EXISTS OVER BOTH THE 
NORTHERN PACIFIC AND THE NORTH ATLANTIC WITH THE 
WARMEST AIR OVER THE LABRADOR SEA.  THE WARM REGION 
OVER CENTRAL ASIA IS WEAKENING.
