Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 248 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Sep 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to major storm levels. A major storm period was observed between
04/0300 - 0600 UTC due to the effects of a coronal hole high speed
stream. Solar wind speed at ACE increased from approximately 450
km/s to 630 km/s.
