B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.  Most of today's activity was quiet to
unsettled.  An isolated period of minor storming was observed
between 21/0900-1200Z.  Solar wind data indicated two sector
boundary crossings during the past 24 hours, which may be related to
the geomagnetic activity.
