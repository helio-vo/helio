B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to severe storm levels.  A recurrent coronal hole was
responsible for the initial elevated conditions.  At approximately
29/1155Z the first of two transients associated with the first two
X-class flares from late on the 27th and early on the 28th passed
the NASA/ACE space craft.  The second occurred at approximately
29/1830Z and was responsible for the severe storm conditions seen
late in the period.  The greater than 10 MeV proton fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit achieved event levels at 28/2335Z and reached a
maximum of 121 pfu at 29/1530Z.  The greater than 2 MeV electron
fluxes at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels today.
