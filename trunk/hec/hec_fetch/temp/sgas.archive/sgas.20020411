B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
levels for most of the day with one period of unsettled conditions
from 15-18Z.  The lingering effects of the high speed stream appear
to be ending.  Greater than 2 MeV electrons have returned to near
background levels after three days of enhancement.
