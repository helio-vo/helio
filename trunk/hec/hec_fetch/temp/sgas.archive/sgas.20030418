B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
unsettled to active during the past 24 hours with a minor  storm
period from 0300-0900 UTC in the mid latitudes, and a minor storm
period at high latitudes from both 0300-1200 UTC and 1500-1800 UTC.
The coronal-hole induced high speed solar wind flow continues. The
greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes reached high levels today.
