Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 134 Issued at 0245Z on 14 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 May

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
unsettled to minor storm levels due to a favorably positioned
coronal hole.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit reached very high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
