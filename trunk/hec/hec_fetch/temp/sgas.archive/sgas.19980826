JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 239 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 27 AUG 1998
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 26 AUG
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  THE GREATER THAN 100 MEV ALERT WAS CANCELLED AT
26/2045UT.  THE PEAK FLUX FOR 100 MEV PARTICLES WAS 3.7 PFU ON
25/0055UT.  THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV ALERT CONTINUES WITH FLUXES AT
THE END OF THE UT DAY NEAR 70 PFU.  THE RUNNING PEAK FOR GT 10 MEV
FLUX WAS 665 PFU AT 26/1055UT.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD HAS BEEN AT
ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS.  A SUDDEN IMPULSE WAS OBSERVED AT
26/0651 UT.  AFTER THE IMPULSE, MID-LATITUDE K-INDICES UP TO 5 WERE
OBSERVED.  A SECONDARY SURGE IN THE SOLAR WIND WAS OBSERVED AT
APPROXIMATELY 1700 UT.  THE SPEED ROSE AND LEVELED OUT OVER 800
KM/S, THE DENSITY INCREASED FROM 2 TO 10 P/CC, AND THE BZ WENT FROM
-2 NT TO -12 NT.  THE FINAL K VALUE FOR 26 AUG WAS A 5.
