Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 319 Issued at 0245Z on 14 Nov 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 08/2350z and reached a maximum of 13,300 pfu at 09/1600Z ended
today at 13/0745Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been
quiet to unsettled during the past 24 hours. The solar wind
continues to show a high-speed solar wind stream, but the average
interplanetary Bz magnetic field component has been weakly positive.
Greater-than-2 MeV electrons at geosynchronous orbit were above
10^3 p/(cm2-s-ster) most of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 144  SSN 099  Afr/Ap 005/008   X-ray Background B4.8
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 4.1e+06   GT 10 MeV 6.6e+05 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
