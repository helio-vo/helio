Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 235 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Aug 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Aug
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active with isolated minor storm periods. The disturbed periods are
due to a slightly elevated solar wind speed (near 500 km/s) and
predominantly southward IMF Bz.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
