B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Isolated active periods were observed during local nighttime
hours at all latitudes. The high speed coronal hole stream
responsible for the disturbed periods over the past few days has
gradually declined to near normal levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous
orbit reached high levels again today.
