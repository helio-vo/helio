Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 172 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Jun 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Jun

C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly unsettled levels today as effects from the western
most recurrent coronal hole wanes.  The greater than 2 MeV electron
flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels today.

K-Indices:
On 16 June, it was determined that a scaling problem exists with the Boulder magnetometer instrument.  While this problem, and its fix are being investigated the primary instrument for Boulder K-indices has been switched to the Boulder USGS (via Domsat) magnetometer, effective 1500 UTC on 16 June.  

GOES Protons:
To ensure continued operational monitoring of important energetic particle data, it is necessary to reassign primary/secondary designations for the GOES Space Environment Monitor (SEM) detectors. GOES 11 (113W) is now the primary satellite for protons. GOES 12 will continue as the primary satellite for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements. GOES 10 (135W) will be the secondary satellite for all SEM sensors - magnetometer, X-ray, and energetic particles.  Because of the degraded state of the proton data on GOES-10, its designation as the secondary source for proton data is a short-term solution.  More permanent solutions have been identified and are being evaluated.  Users will be notified when we define and schedule a permanent fix.
