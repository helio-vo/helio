Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 135 Issued at 0245Z on 15 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
unsettled to minor storm levels due to a favorably positioned
coronal hole.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

F.  Comments:  The GOES 10 energetic proton detectors are showing
intermittent, high noise levels in the higher energy proton channels
(greater than about 80 MeV). This problem was first noticed in data
taken April 26, 2003. To ensure continued operational monitoring of
important energetic particle data, it is necessary to reassign
primary/secondary designations for the GOES Space Environment
Monitor (SEM) detectors. Beginning 1500 UT on May 15, GOES-8 will
once again become the primary satellite for protons. GOES 12 will be
the primary satellite for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron
measurements. GOES 10 will be the secondary satellite for all SEM
sensors - magnetometer, X-ray sensor, and energetic particle sensor.
This short-term solution (approximately 2 - 3 months) will be in
place until we define and implement a permanent fix. A more detailed
explanation can be found at: http://www.sec.noaa.gov/GOES.html.
