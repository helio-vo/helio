Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 150 Issued at 0245Z on 30 May 2013
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 29 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 2.0e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 2.50e+09 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1 Planetary 1 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit reached very high levels during the summary
period. Particle measurements are being reported from the
GOES-15
satellite due to a GOES-13 outage.
