Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 033 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Feb 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. Solar wind speed remains elevated, but gradually declined
from near 620 km/s to 500 km/s to end the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 084  SSN 027  Afr/Ap 006/006   X-ray Background A4.0
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.3e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.9e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W108 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 9.50e+07 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:

F.  Comments:  The energetic event in section A was likely associated
with a large backsided halo CME from old Region 720 (N13, L=178),
which is due to return to the visible disk on 05 February.
