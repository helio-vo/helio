Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 140 Issued at 0245Z on 20 May 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm conditions.  Minor storming subsided after
19/0900 UTC to quiet to unsettled conditions.  This activity
correlates well with the full halo CME observed on 16 May.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
