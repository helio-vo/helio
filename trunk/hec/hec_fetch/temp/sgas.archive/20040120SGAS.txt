B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Solar wind speed remains elevated (550 to 660 km/s) since
the onset of a high speed coronal hole stream on 16 January. IMF Bz
was predominantly northward although there were some periods of
sustained southward Bz.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
