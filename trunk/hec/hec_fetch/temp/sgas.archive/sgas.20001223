B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled at all latitudes for the past 24 hours.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM FRIDAY
A STRONG ANTICYCLONE, TILTING FROM WESTERN EUROPE IN THE LOWER
STRATOSPHERE TO NORTHERN RUSSIA IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE,
DOMINATES THE CIRCULATION OVER EUROPE AND ASIA WHILE THE 
CENTER OF THE COLD POLAR VORTEX IS SITUATED BETWEEN THE 
CANADIAN ARCTIC IN THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE AND ALASKA IN THE
UPPER STRATOSPHERE.  A RETURN TO NORMAL WINTER CONDITIONS
IS EXPECTED WITHIN THE NEXT 5 DAYS.
