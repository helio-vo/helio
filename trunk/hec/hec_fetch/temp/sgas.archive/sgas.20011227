B.  Proton Events:  Greater than 100 MeV and 10 MeV proton events
occurred in association with today's major flare. The greater than
100 MeV event started at 26/0555 UTC, reached a peak of 50 pfu at
26/0720 UTC, and ended at 26/1935 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV event
started at 26/0605 UTC, reached a peak of 779 pfu at 26/1115 UTC,
and continues in progress.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM WEDNESDAY
STRONG STRATOSPHERIC WARMING IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE,
INTENSIFYING.  TEMPERATURE GRADIENT REVERSED BETWEEN 60N AND THE
POLE FROM 10 TO 1 HPA, WITHIN 5 DAYS EXPECTED TO BE REVERSED BETWEEN
50 TO 5 HPA.  EASTERLY ZONAL REAN WINDS AT 60N FROM 3 TO 1 HPA,
WITHIN 3 DAYS EXPECTED TO PROPAGATE DOWN TO 5 HPA.

F.  Comments:  The particle event discussed in part B. was associated
with a GLE starting at about 26/0600 UTC and reaching a maximum at
about 26/0620 UTC (8% at Apatity, Oulu, and McMurdo, and 2% at
Moscow). A Polar Cap Absorption event (PCA) also occurred, reaching
a peak absorption of about 9 dB at 26/1115 UTC and continuing in
progress at this writing.
