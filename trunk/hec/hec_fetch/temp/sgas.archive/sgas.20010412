B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 0850 UTC on 10 April continues in progress. The peak flux so far
is 355 PFU at 2055 UTC on 11 April. The day end flux value was 113
PFU.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to severe storm levels, with a maximum estimated Kp-index of
8. A sudden storm commencement was observed at 1343Z on 11 April.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
