Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 071 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Mar 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Mostly quiet.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists Sunday.
As a result of the major warming, the circulation in the lower
stratosphere remains further disturbed leading to a reversed
temperature gradient up to 20 HPA. In the middle and upper
stratosphere, a cold and elongated polar vortex is reestablished.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 158  SSN 139  Afr/Ap 005/004   X-ray Background B6.0
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.6e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.3e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 9.10e+06 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
