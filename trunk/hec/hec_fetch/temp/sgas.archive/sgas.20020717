B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event began at
geosynchronous orbit at 16/1750 UTC. The 10 MeV flux at the close of
the period was 32 pfu and gradually increasing.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity was at
quiet to active levels. Active levels occurred at some high latitude
stations during 16/1800-2100 UTC.
