B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 105  SSN 075  Afr/Ap 008/008   X-ray Background B2.6
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.4e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.2e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 2.10e+09 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 4 3 2 2 2 1 1 Planetary 3 3 2 2 1 2 0 1 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit reached very high levels during the summary
period. Particle measurements are being reported from the
GOES-15
satellite due to a GOES-13 outage.
