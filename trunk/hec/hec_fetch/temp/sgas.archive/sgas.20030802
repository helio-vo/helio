Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 214 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Aug 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
active to minor storm levels.  A large polar-connected coronal hole
which has maintained a high-speed solar wind stream, combined with a
series of periods where the interplanetary magnetic field has been
oriented Southward, maintained elevated activity.
