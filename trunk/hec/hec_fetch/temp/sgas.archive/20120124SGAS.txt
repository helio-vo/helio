B.  Proton Events:  Proton levels are high.  A 10 MeV proton event
began at 23/0530Z and reached a peak of 3630 pfu at 23/2330Z and
remains elevated.  A 100 MeV proton event began at 23/0445Z and
reached a maximum of 2.3 pfu at 23/0750Z before decreasing below the
1 pfu threshold.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field began the
period at minor storm levels and then decreased to mostly quiet for
the remainder of the day.
