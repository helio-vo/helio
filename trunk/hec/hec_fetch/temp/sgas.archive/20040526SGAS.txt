Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 147 Issued at 0245Z on 26 May 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 102  SSN 101  Afr/Ap 006/008   X-ray Background B1.5
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 2.0e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.3e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W96 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.20e+07 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 Planetary 2 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 
F.  Comments:  NOTE: The ACE spacecraft orbit will 
bring ACE nearly in line with the Sun from about 
May 30 to June 2, 2004. During that time solar radio 
noise is expected to interfere with spacecraft 
telemetry resulting in the loss of solar wind 
plasma, magnetic field, and particle data.
