Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 115 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Apr 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active periods. A weak recurrent coronal
hole high speed stream continues. Solar wind speed is elevated to
near 550 km/s, but the IMF Bz is weak and predominantly northward.
