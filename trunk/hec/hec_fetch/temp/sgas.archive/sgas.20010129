Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 029 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Jan 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Jan

B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event began at
2025Z. The peak flux for the 28th was 22 pfu at 2220Z. The event was
still in progress at the end of the day.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels during the past 24 hours.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists Sunday.
Minor warming continues with the highest temperatures at
10 HPA over central Siberia and at 1 HPA over Franz Josef
land with a maximum temperature of +49 C leading to a
reversed temperature gradient between 60N and the pole in
1 HPA.
