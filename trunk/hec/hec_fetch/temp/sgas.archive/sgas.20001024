Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 298 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Oct 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to active levels through 23/1800UT, then fell to quiet
levels thereafter, as coronal hole high speed stream effects waned.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
