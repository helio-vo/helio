B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 and greater than 100 MeV proton
event occurred following yesterday's X17 flare on the southeast
limb. The greater than 10 MeV proton event began at 08/0215Z and
remains in progress. The peak flux so far was 112 pfu at 08/2155Z.
The greater than 100 MeV proton event began at 08/0405Z and also
remains in progress. The peak flux was 7.5 pfu at 08/1925Z.  A
greater than 100 MeV proton event from a source on the east limb is
extremely rare.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. A sudden disturbance of 41 nT (magnetic crochet) was
observed in the geomagnetic field following today's X5 flare.
