Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 040 Issued at 0245Z on 09 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 08 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to unsettled with an isolated active period between 08/1200 -
1500Z.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT / SATURDAY / STRATWARM EXISTS.
IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE, STILL DISTURBED TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION WITH A DECAYING WARM REGION OVER NORTHERN SIBERIA. 
THIS STILL LEADS TO A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND
THE POLE FROM 3 TO 1 HPA.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 139  SSN 162  Afr/Ap 012/013   X-ray Background B3.1
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.8e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.5e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
