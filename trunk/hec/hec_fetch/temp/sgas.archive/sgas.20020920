B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels. A weak shock was observed at the ACE
spacecraft just before 19/0600Z. Solar wind speed gradually
increased to over 750 km/s by late in the period, but total magnetic
field measurements and densities remained very low. This disturbance
is likely associated with the C8 flare and CME observed on 17
