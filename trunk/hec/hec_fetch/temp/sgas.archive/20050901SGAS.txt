Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 244 Issued at 0245Z on 01 Sep 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 31 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  The elevated conditions ensued following a
sustained southward Bz (ranging between -10 and -20 nT) which began
just after 31/1000Z.  This activity is believed to be in response to
a corotating interaction region.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
