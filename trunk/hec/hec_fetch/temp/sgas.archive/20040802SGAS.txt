Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 215 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Aug 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels.  A shock passage was observed by the ACE
spacecraft at approximately 01/0130Z.  This transient is believed to
be the result of the long duration C2 x-ray flare that peaked at
29/1304Z from old Region 652 (N08, L=348) while it was exiting the
west limb.  The Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field
went south for a brief period of time allowing for observed active
periods between 01/0130 and 0300Z.
