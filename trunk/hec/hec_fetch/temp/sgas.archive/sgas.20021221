Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary

This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Dec

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux at
geosynchronous orbit became elevated following the M2.7 event early
in the period but did not exceed event threshold levels.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  The elevated conditions are due to a
geoeffective recurrent positive polarity coronal hole high speed
stream.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached moderate
levels late in the day.
