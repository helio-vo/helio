B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event continues in
progress. The event began at 22/1755 UTC, reached a maximum of 820
PFU at 23/1055 UTC and was at 18.5 PFU at the end of the day.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to severe storm levels. Two sudden impulses were observed: the
first at 1051 UTC measured 87 nT in Boulder and the second at 1545
UTC measured 26 nT in Boulder.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
