Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 299 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Oct 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Solar wind speed is elevated at approximately 450
km/s due to a geoeffective coronal hole high speed wind stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
