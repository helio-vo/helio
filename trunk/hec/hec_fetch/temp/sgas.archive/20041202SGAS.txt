Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 337 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Dec 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Dec

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels over the past 24 hours. Most periods
were quiet to unsettled. An isolated active to minor storm period
was observed from 0600 to 0900 UTC. ACE RTSW observations suggest
the continued influence of a high-speed solar wind stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
