Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 106 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Apr 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  Solar wind velocity was elevated
near 575 km/s and a prolonged period of southward Bz produced active
conditions for most of the day with one period of isolated minor
storm levels.  By the end of the day Bz shifted northward and
activity has subsided to unsettled levels.  Greater than 2 MeV
electron flux reached high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
