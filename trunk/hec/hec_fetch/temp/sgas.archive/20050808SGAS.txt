Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 220 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Aug 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels, with minor storm conditions observed at high
latitudes between 07/0300 - 0600 UTC.  Solar wind speed remains
elevated at approximately 575 km/s, but Bt has decreased to about 5
nT.
