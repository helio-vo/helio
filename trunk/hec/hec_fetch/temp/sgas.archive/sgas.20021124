B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Minor to major storm conditions were experienced
between 23/0300 to 0600 UTC due to high speed solar wind resulting
from the from the favorably positioned coronal hole in the western
solar hemisphere.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosychronous orbit reached high levels today.
