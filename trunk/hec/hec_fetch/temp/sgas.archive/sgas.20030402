Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 092 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Apr 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels, with occasional major storming at high
latitudes.  The high speed stream that began early on 30 March
continued during the period.  The greater than 2 MeV electrons at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None

F.  Comments:  Beginning 1500 UTC April 8, SEC will begin using data
from the GOES 12 satellite, and stop receiving GOES 8 data. GOES 12
has the new Solar X-Ray Imager (SXI), which will acquire real-time,
operational images of the solar x-ray flux. With the switch from
GOES 8 to GOES 12, the primary/secondary designations will change.
GOES 12 will be the primary satellite for the SXI. All other data,
including magnetometer, XRS x-ray measurements, and energetic
particles, will have GOES 10 as their primary source, with GOES 12
as the secondary source where available. Please see
http://www.sec.noaa.gov/GOES.html for important information on this
changeover.
