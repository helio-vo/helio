B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field conditions
ranged from quiet to major storm levels.  Onset of coronal hole high
speed stream effects were evident since about 11/0900 UTC, and the
single period of major storm conditions observed at higher latitudes
occurred shortly thereafter.  The remainder of the day had
conditions in the unsettled to minor storm range.
