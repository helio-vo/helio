Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 127 Issued at 0245Z on 06 May 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. A high speed coronal hole stream became geoeffective late in
the period. Solar wind speed increased from near 450 km/s to
approximately 600 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
