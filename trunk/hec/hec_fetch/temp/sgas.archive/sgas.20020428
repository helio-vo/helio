Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 118 Issued at 0245Z on 28 Apr 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 27 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV protons at geosynchronous
orbit remain elevated, but are slowly returning to baseline
following the proton event that began on 21 Apr and ended on the
26th.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet, but became unsettled late in the period. Solar wind indices
on ACE suggest that we are transitioning into a high speed coronal
hole stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 157  SSN 173  Afr/Ap 008/008   X-ray Background B7.2
