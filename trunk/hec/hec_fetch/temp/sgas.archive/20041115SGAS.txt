Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 320 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Nov 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 07/1910Z, officially ended on 13/1600Z. The peak flux was 495 pfu
on 08/0115Z with a secondary peak of 424 pfu on 10/1655Z. This
proton event followed X2 flares on 07 and 10 November. The greater
than 10 MeV protons remain elevated, but are slowly returning to
background levels.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active periods. Elevated solar wind speed
(450 - 550 km/s) and a southward period of IMF Bz between 13/2300 -
14/0300Z generated the active periods.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
