Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 236 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Aug 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to major storm levels.  A fifteen hour period of minor
storm with one period of major storm levels was observed today.  The
greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at geosynchronous orbit reached
high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
