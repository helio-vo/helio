Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 260 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Sep 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Sep

B.  Proton Events:   The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 08/0215 UTC and reached a maximum of 1880 pfu at 11/0425 UTC
ended at 16/0025 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Active levels were the result of the high solar
wind speeds early in the UTC day.  The solar wind speed declined
over the past 24 hours from about 700 km/s to about 575 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was very high today.
