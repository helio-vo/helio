Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 040 Issued at 0245Z on 09 Feb 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 08 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to major storm levels.  The heightened activity was due to
the effects of a high speed coronal hole stream.  Solar wind speed
at ACE has been elevated at approximately 700 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
