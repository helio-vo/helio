Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 320 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Nov 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Nov

C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to major storm levels.  At approximately 0520Z a shock was
observed passing the NASA/ACE spacecraft and subsequently produced
minor to major storm levels at Earth.
