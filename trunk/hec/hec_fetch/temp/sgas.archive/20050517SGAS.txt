B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels with a period of major storm conditions
between 16/0300 UTC and 0600 UTC.  Solar wind speed at ACE has been
steadily decreasing from approximately 700 km/s to 550 km/s until
16/2240 UTC when the speed increased to 600 km/s.  The Bz component
of the IMF has remained south between -1 nT and -10 nT during this
reporting period.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit was high today.
