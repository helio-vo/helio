Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 221 Issued at 0245Z on 09 Aug 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 08 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to unsettled levels.  Solar wind speed has decreased over the
past 24 hours from approximately 600 km/s to 540 km/s as the coronal
hole high speed stream declines.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 086  SSN 056  Afr/Ap 008/008   X-ray Background B1.0
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 6.4e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.2e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W113 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.60e+09 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W76 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 3 3 1 3 2 2 3 Planetary 2 2 3 1 2 2 1 3 
F.  Comments:  The greater then 2 MeV electron fluence as measured by
GOES-12 reached very high levels.
