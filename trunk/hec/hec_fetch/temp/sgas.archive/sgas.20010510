Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 130 Issued at 0245Z on 10 May 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 07/1915 UTC ended at 08/1935 UTC. The peak of the event was 30
pfu at 08/0755 UTC. The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes attained
high levels briefly during the past 24 hours.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to minor storm levels during the past 24 hours. Enhanced
solar wind velocity, and periods of sustained southward solar wind
magnetic field orientation led to an increase in geomagnetic
activity. The plasma and field parameters appear to be consistent
with the passage of an interplanetary transient. Minor storm periods
were observed from 0000-0600 UTC, and active conditions dominated
most of the remainder of the day.
