SGAS Number 021 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Jan 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. Solar wind speed at ACE has decreased from approximately
650 km/s to 570 km/s.
