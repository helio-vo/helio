Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 021 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Jan 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels with a brief period of minor storm conditions
(between 20/0000 to 0300 UTC) at high latitudes.  Coronal hole high
speed stream effects from a southern polar extension are believed to
be responsible for the elevated activity.  The greater than 2 MeV
electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached moderate levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/MONDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
WARMING CONTINUES OVER THE POLAR REGION, FURTHER WEAKENING. REVERSED
TERPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE FROM 50 TO 5 HPA.
EASTERLY ZONAL MEAN ZONAL WIND AT 60N BETWEEN 5 AND 2 HPA.
