B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  HE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS
PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE. ISOLATED MINOR STORMING WAS ALSO
OBSERVED. THE SOURCE OF THIS DISTURBANCE IS UNKNOWN. SOLAR WIND
PARAMETERS WERE REASONABLY BENIGN EXCEPT FOR SOME PERIODS OF
NEGATIVE BZ AND THE PASSAGE OF A SECTOR BOUNDARY DURING THE PERIOD.
D.  STRATWARM:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM FRIDAY
FINAL WARMING SLOWLY PROGRESSES. THE WARM CENTER
OVER NORTHERN SIBERIA/NORTHEASTERN EUROPE EXTENDS
FURTHER POLEWARDS WHILE THE RESTS OF THE COLD AIR
WILL BE SHIFTED TO MIDDLE LATITUDES. THE WEAKENING
VORTEX MOVES FROM THE CANADIAN TO THE EUROPEAN
ARCTIC AND AN ANTICYCLONE DEVELOPS OVER ALASKA AND
THE ADJACENT ARCTIC. TEMPERATURE GRADIENT REVERSED
BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE IN THE MIDDLE AND
UPPER STRATOSPHERE AND CIRCULATION REVERSAL
EXPECTED AROUND MID-APRIL.
LAST MESSAGE OF THIS WINTER SEASON.
