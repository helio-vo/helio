Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 356 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly at quiet to active levels as the geoeffective coronal
hole high speed stream wanes.  Middle and high latitudes experienced
storming conditions between 21/0300 and 0600 UTC.
