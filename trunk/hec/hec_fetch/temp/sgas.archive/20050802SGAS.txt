Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 214 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Aug 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 27/2300Z ended at 01/1040Z, a maximum of 41 pfu occurred at
29/1715Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  The elevated activity may be attributed to a weak
transient that was observed at the ACE spacecraft at approximately
01/0500Z.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
