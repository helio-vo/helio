Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 342 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels due to coronal hole effects.  Solar wind velocities
reached peak values near 600 km/s at 07/0900 UTC and have stabilized
near 550 km/s.  The Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic
field has been predominantly positive resulting in only isolated
active conditions.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
