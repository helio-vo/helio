Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 356 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Dec 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. An increase in the solar wind speed began at around
21/1100Z. This increase was accompanied by sustained periods of
southward Bz resulting in unsettled to active periods at all
latitudes.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM FRIDAY
STRATOSPHERIC WARMING IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE,
FURTHER INTENSIFYING WITH A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT
BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE IN THE UPPERMOST LEVELS EXPECTED
WITHIN THE NEXT 3 DAYS.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
