Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 318 Issued at 0245Z on 13 Nov 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0848 0849 0849                       150                           
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event continued to
show flux levels just above threshold throughout the period with a
very slow decline.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
minor storm.  One isolated period of minor storm conditions was
observed from 12/0300 - 0600Z.  Solar wind observations indicate the
presence of a high speed stream associated with a favorably
positioned, transequatorial coronal hole.
