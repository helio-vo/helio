Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 042 Issued at 0245Z on 11 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 10 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to unsettled with active periods at all latitudes between
10/0300 - 0900Z. A slightly elevated solar wind velocity and
southward turning in the interplanetary magnetic field account for
the most disturbed periods.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/MONDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE STILL SLIGHTLY DISTURBED
TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION WITH A DECAYING WARM REGION OVER SIBERIA
WHICH STILL LEADS TO A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND
THE POLE AT 2 AND 1 HPA.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 136  SSN 163  Afr/Ap 012/016   X-ray Background B3.1
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.3e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.3e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 6.10e+07 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 4 4 3 2 2 3 3 Planetary 3 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit once again reached high levels.
