Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 240 Issued at 0245Z on 27 Aug 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 Aug

F.  Comments:  The ACE spacecraft orbit will bring ACE to its
closest approach with the Sun on August 30, 
2004. During that time possible solar radio
noise may interfere with spacecraft telemetry 
resulting in the loss of real time solar
wind plasma, magnetic field, and particle data.
