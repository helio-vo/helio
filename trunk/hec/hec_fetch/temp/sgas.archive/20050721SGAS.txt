Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 202 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Jul 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to active levels.  Solar wind data indicate the onset of a
high speed stream from a coronal hole, beginning at about 19/2300. 
The solar wind speed was approximately 550 km/s with a slight upward
trend at the time of issue.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
