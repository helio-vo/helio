B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field began the
period at an quiet levels, before the onset of CME impacts. The
second period observed active levels, then a period of major storm
levels followed by a period of minor storm levels. Activity
increased further to severe storm levels for the remaining periods
of the day.
