B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly quiet to unsettled levels.  Isolated active periods
were observed at both middle and high latitudes during the interval.
The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit
reached high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
