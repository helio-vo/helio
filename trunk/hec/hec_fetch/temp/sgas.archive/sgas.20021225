Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 359 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  A weak transient was observed by the NASA/ACE
spacecraft at approximately 24/1300 UTC.  Solar wind speed increased
to near 575 km/s and Bz was slightly negative.  The greater than 2
MeV electron flux at geo-synchronous orbit reached high levels
today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
