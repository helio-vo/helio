Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 292 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Oct 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet.
Very stable solar wind conditions persisted through the period.
Solar wind speed declined to near 300 km/s and IMF Bz remains near
zero.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 7.9e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.4e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W101 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence

(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W74 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 0 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 Planetary 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was at high levels.
