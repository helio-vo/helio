Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 068 Issued at 0245Z on 09 Mar 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 08 Mar
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet to unsettled levels.  There was an isolated active period at
mid latitudes in response to a southward oscillation in the Bz
component of the interplanetary magnetic field between 08/1500 and
1800Z.  The coronal hole high speed stream that has been
geoeffective for the past several days appears to have rotated out
of its favorable position early in the period.  The greater than 2
MeV electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels
again today.
