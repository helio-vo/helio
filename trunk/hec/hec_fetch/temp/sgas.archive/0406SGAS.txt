B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm conditions. Minor storm periods were observed from
05/0900 to 1200 UTC and 05/1200 to 1500 UTC. Heightened activity was
due to sustained periods of southward Bz coupled with an increase in
the total magnetic field.
