Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 231 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Aug 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV solar energetic proton
event has ended (start 16/0135 UTC, 493 pfu peak at 16/0355 UTC, and
end 18/1845 UTC).
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 156  SSN 148  Afr/Ap 016/014   X-ray Background B5.9
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 6.2e+06   GT 10 MeV 9.4e+05 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV ***** e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 3 3 1 4 4 2 4 Planetary 3 3 3 2 3 4 3 3 
F.  Comments:  The GT 2 MeV electron fluence is not available due to
sensor degradation caused by the GT 10 MeV solar energetic proton
event.
