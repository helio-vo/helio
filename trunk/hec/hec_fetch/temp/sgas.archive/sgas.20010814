Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 226 Issued at 0245Z on 14 Aug 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels, due to the ongoing influence of
yesterday's shock passage from the CME activity of 09 August.  Some
additional influence from a weak high speed stream appears to have
developed over the past 12 hours, maintaining predominantly
unsettled conditions throughout the latter portion of the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
