Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 315 Issued at 0245Z on 11 Nov 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 10 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event remains in
progress (start--09/1920 UTC and 404 pfu peak at 10/0540 UTC). The
proton flux at 10/2400 UTC was about 20 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels. The CME material noted yesterday
appears to have passed.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
