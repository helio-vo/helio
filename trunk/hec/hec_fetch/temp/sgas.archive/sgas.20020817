B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  A slight indication of a weak
shock passage at the ACE spacecraft was observed at the beginning of
the period.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geo-synchronous
orbit exceeded threshold at 16/1505 UTC, preliminary maximum flux
was 1340 pfu at 16/1530 UTC.
