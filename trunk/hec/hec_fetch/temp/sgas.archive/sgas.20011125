Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 329 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Nov 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  Today's interplanetary shock passages enhanced
the already high 10 MeV proton integral flux to a peak value of
18900 pfu at 24/0555 UTC.  By the end of the day, the event remained
in progress with a flux value of about 190 pfu.  The 100 MeV proton
event ended at 24/1200 UTC.  Max flux observed was 4.6 pfu at
24/0225 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity ranged
from quiet to severe storm levels.  The onset of storm conditions
began with two sudden impulse observations: 20nt at 24/0500 UTC,
followed by 80nt at 24/0555 UTC.  Severe storm conditions were
evident in planetary K-index values during 24/0600-1800 UTC.  This
event is the likely result of interaction among up to three
interplanetary shock propagations from separate CME events during
21-23 November, indicated by re-analysis of shock arrival model
predictions with improved event velocity data.  Results suggest that
the CMEs may have merged into the single interplanetary shock that
passed the earth today.
