Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 349 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.  Solar wind data from the ACE satellite indicated the
development of high speed stream effects over the course of the day
from a favorably positioned coronal hole.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
