Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 276 Issued at 0245Z on 03 Oct 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 02 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. IMF signatures are consistent with a transient passage,
but solar wind speed has remained quite low (300 - 400 km/s);
consequently, geomagnetic field impact was minimal.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
