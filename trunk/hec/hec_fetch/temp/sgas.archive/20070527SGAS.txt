Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 147 Issued at 0245Z on 27 May 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active due to the continued influence of a geoeffective
coronal hole high speed stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
