Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 354 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Dec 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  Active periods due to the continued influence of a
geoeffective high speed coronal hole stream.  Solar wind speed at
ACE has decreased from approximately 640 km/s to 510 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
