Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 121 Issued at 0245Z on 01 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to major storm levels.  Most of the activity was at active
to minor storm levels.  Periods of southward Bz early in the day
resulted in an isolated period of major storm levels.  Solar wind
speed gradually increased throughout the day to near 650 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
