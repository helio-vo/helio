JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 046 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 15 FEB 2000
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 14 FEB
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
NONE
B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET
TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS. A TRANSIENT, WITH ENHANCED MAGNETIC FIELDS,
PASSED ACE AROUND 0700Z. THESE STRONG FIELDS, COUPLED WITH THE
ALREADY FASTER THAN USUAL SOLAR WIND ( 700 KM/S), SET OFF INTERVALS
OF MINOR TO MAJOR STORMING AT ALL LATITUDES. THE SOLAR WIND SPEED
HAS SINCE DROPPED, NOW JUST LESS THAN 600 KM/S.
D.  STRATWARM:  STRATWARM ALERT/MONDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
MINOR WARMING CONTINUES, SLOWLY WEAKENING.
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT REVERSED BETWEEN 60N
AND THE POLE IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE.
E.  DAILY INDICES: (REAL-TIME PRELIMINARY/ESTIMATED VALUES)
10 CM 159  SSN 158  AFR/AP 022/029   X-RAY BACKGROUND B8.1
