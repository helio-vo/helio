B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels with one three hour period of active conditions
(00-03 UTC).  Greater than 2 MeV electrons at geosynchronous orbit
reached moderate levels with a maxium value of 783 pfu at 13/1525
UTC.
