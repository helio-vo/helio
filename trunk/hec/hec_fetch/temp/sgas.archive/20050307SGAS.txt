Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 066 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Mar 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to minor storm levels.  A recurrent coronal hole high
speed stream became geoeffective early in the period.  Solar wind
speeds increased from 380 km/s to near 650 km/s by the end of the
period.
