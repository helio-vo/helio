This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Dec

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS SATURDAY
STRONG ANTICYCLONE, TILTING FROM ICELAND IN THE LOWER
STRATOSPHERE TOWARDS THE URAL MOUNTIAINS IN THE UPPER
STRATOSPHERE, CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE CIRCULATION
OVER EUROPE AND ASIA BUT WILL DISAPPEAR WITHIN THE NEXT 
5 DAYS.  PROGNOSIS SHOW THE RETURN TO NORMAL WINTER
CONDITIONS WITH THE CENTER OF THE COLD POLAR VORTEX MOVING
TOWARDS THE EUROPEAN SECTOR OF THE ACTIC.  END OF THIS
GEOALERT PERIOD.
