B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists stratwarm Sunday
Lower stratosphere circulation remains disturbed as
a result of the major warming.  Reversed temperature
gradient up to 20 hpa.  The vortex is weakening and
becoming less disturbed.  Slow transition to summer
conditions most probable.
