Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 242 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Aug 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1734 1734 1734                       120                           
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly quiet to unsettled levels.  There was an isolated
active period that occurred between 28/0600 and 0900Z in response to
southward Bz oscillations in the interplanetary magnetic field.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

F.  Comments:  The ACE spacecraft orbit will 
bring ACE to its closest approach with the Sun 
on August 30, 2004. During that time possible 
solar radio noise may interfere with spacecraft 
telemetry resulting in the loss of real time 
solar wind plasma, magnetic field, and particle 
data.
