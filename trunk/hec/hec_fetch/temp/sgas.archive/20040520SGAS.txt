Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 141 Issued at 0245Z on 20 May 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to unsettled. An isolated active period occurred at some
locations at 19/1500-1800 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 109  SSN 087  Afr/Ap 005/006   X-ray Background B1.7
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.3e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.4e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W96 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 2.20e+06 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 1 3 1 3 3 4 3 3 Planetary 1 2 1 1 3 2 2 2 
F.  Comments:  The ACE spacecraft orbit will bring ACE nearly in line
with the Sun from about May 30 to June 2, 2004. During that time
solar radio noise is expected to interfere with spacecraft telemetry
resulting in the loss of solar wind plasma, magnetic field, and
particle data.
