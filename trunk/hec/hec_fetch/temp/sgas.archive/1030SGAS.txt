Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 303 Issued at 0245Z on 30 Oct 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 29 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active. Activity was due to the continued influence of
a geoeffective coronal hole high speed stream. Solar wind speed at
ACE is currently elevated around 580 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
