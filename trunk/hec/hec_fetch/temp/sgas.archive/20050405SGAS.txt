Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 095 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Apr 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  Heightened activity was due to the onset of a coronal hole
high speed stream.  Solar wind speed at ACE increased from
approximately 350 km/s to 600 km/s during the reporting period.
