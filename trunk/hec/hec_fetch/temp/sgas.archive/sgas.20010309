B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists Thursday.
As a result of the major warming, the circulation in the lower
stratosphere remains disturbed. Reversed temperature gradient
between 60N and the pole in the lower and middle stratosphere.
