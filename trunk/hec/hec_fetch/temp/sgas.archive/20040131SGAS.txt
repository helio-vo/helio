Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 031 Issued at 0245Z on 31 Jan 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels. Solar wind information from the NASA
ACE spacecraft suggest that the geomagnetic field is under the
influence of a high-speed coronal hole stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 093  SSN 042  Afr/Ap 015/017   X-ray Background B1.6
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 6.6e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.2e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W102 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 3.30e+07 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 2 3 3 5 4 3 3 2 Planetary 2 3 3 5 4 3 3 3 
F.  Comments:  The Afr index reported in Part E is estimated from
Boulder observations.
