Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 357 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Dec 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active. A high speed coronal hole stream is creating
occasional active periods.
