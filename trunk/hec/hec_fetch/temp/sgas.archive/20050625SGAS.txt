Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 176 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Jun 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  The storm conditions are due to a recurrent
coronal hole.  The associated solar wind speeds have been elevated
to near 500 km/sec throughout most of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
