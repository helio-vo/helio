Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 356 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Dec 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels, with isolated minor storm periods at high
latitudes. A high speed coronal hole stream is responsible for the
disturbed periods. Solar wind speed is in slow decline and ended the
period near 600 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
