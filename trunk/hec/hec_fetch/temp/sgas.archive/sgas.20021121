B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  NASA/ACE depicted a modest increase in the solar
wind speed beginning at approximately 20/1000 UTC.  The Bz component
of the interplanetary magnetic field made a sharp southward movement
just prior to 20/1600 UTC which brought about the onset of active
conditions at all latitudes.
