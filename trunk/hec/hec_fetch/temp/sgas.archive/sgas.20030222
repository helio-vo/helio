Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 053 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Feb
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. The disturbed periods are due to a declining high speed
solar wind stream. This high speed stream began the period near 700
km/s, but declined slowly throughout the day to 550 km/s by the end
of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT / FRIDAY / STRATWARM EXISTS.
THE WAVE TWO FORMATION IS STILL EVIDENT.  THERE IS A REVERSED
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT THROUGHOUT THE STRATOSPHERE AND EASTERLY WINDS
AT 1 HPA AT 60N.
