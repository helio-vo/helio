B.  Proton Events:  The S1 (Minor) solar radiation storm which began
at 18/1525 UTC ended at 20/1155 UTC and reached a maximum value of
58 pfu at 19/0105 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field reached G1
(Minor) geomagnetic storm levels at 20/1200-1500 UTC followed by
active conditons for the remainder of the period due to coronal mass
ejection (CME) effects.
