B.  Proton Events:  The X17 flare that occurred at 28/1110Z produced
proton events at greater than 10 and greater than 100 MeV which
remain in progress at this time. The greater than 100 MeV event
began at 28/1145Z with a maximum so far of 186 pfu. The greater than
10 MeV proton event began at 28/1215Z with a maximum so far of over
13,000 pfu. A polar cap absorption began at 28/1237Z and remains in
progress.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. A CME was observed to pass the ACE spacecraft at around
28/0130Z. Solar wind speed rose to near 800 km/s, but Bz stayed
northward, thwarting a significant geomagnetic response.
