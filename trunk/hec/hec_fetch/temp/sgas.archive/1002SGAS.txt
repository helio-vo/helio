Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 275 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Oct 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm conditions. Activity was due to the continued
influence of a coronal hole high speed stream.
