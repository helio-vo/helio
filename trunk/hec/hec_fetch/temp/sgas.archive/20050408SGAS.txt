Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 098 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Apr 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.  Solar wind speed at ACE continued to decline over the
period from approximately 500 km/s to 410 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
