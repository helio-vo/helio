Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 041 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to unsettled with isolated active periods. Solar wind
conditions were at near nominal levels, but periods of weak
southward IMF Bz yielded the occasional active periods.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT / SUNDAY / STRATWARM EXISTS.
IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE, STILL DISTURBED TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION WITH A DECAYING WARM REGION OVER NORTHERN SIBERIA WHICH
STILL LEADS TO A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE
POLE FROM 3 TO1 HPA.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 141  SSN 194  Afr/Ap 012/015   X-ray Background B3.2
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 3.0e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.3e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.00e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 3 4 2 2 4 2 2 Planetary 3 3 4 2 3 4 3 3 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit remain considerably enhanced, reaching high
levels again this period.
