Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 096 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Apr 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to active levels with one period of minor storm
conditions.  Solar wind was stable near 500 km/s until late in the
period when it increased to over 550 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 4.7e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence

F.  Comments:  Beginning 1500 UTC April 8, SEC will begin using data
from the GOES 12 satellite, and stop receiving GOES 8 data. GOES 12
has the new Solar X-Ray Imager (SXI), which will acquire real-time,
operational images of the solar x-ray flux. With the switch from
GOES 8 to GOES 12, the primary/secondary designations will change.
GOES 12 will be the primary satellite for the SXI. All other data,
including magnetometer, XRS x-ray measurements, and energetic
particles, will have GOES 10 as their primary source, with GOES 12
as the secondary source where available. Please see
http://www.sec.noaa.gov/GOES.html for important information on this
changeover.
