Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 204 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Jul 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled during the past 24 hours. The greater than 2 MeV electron
fluxes declined from high levels at 21/2325 UTC and remained below
this threshold for the remainder of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
