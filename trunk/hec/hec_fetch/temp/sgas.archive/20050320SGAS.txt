B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.  An isolated period of minor storming
occurred between 19/0000 and 0300 UTC.  This elevated conditions
were most likely due to a sustained southward Bz and a slight
increase in the solar wind speeds to approximately 460 km/s.
