B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 110  SSN 066  Afr/Ap 003/004   X-ray Background B2.3
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 4.5e+06   GT 10 MeV 7.6e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W113 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 5.50e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W76 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 1 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 Planetary 1 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 
F.  Comments:  The Afr index reported in Part E is estimated from
Boulder observations. The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was high.
