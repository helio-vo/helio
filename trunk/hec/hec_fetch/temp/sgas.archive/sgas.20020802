B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels with one period of minor storm conditions.  A shock
passage was observed by the NASA/ACE spacecraft at 01/0425 UTC and a
corresponding 26 nT sudden impulse was recorded at 01/0511 UTC on
the Boulder magnetometer.   Active to minor storm conditions
followed the sudden impulse.
