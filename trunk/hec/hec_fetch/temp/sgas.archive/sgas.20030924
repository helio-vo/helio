Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 267 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Sep 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet to active levels.  A coronal hole induced high speed stream
continues to be geoeffective, causing minor disruptions in the
Earth's magnetic field.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
