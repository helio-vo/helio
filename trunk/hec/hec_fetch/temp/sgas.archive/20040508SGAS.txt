Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 129 Issued at 0245Z on 08 May 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 May
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. The high speed coronal hole stream that became geoeffective
on 05 May continues to buffet the geomagnetic field. Frequent
southward IMF Bz oscillations over the last 24 hours are responsible
for the most disturbed periods. The high speed stream does appear to
be subsiding: solar wind speed decreased to below 500 km/s late in
the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
