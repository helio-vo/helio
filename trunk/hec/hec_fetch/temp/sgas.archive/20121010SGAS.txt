Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 284 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Oct 2012
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 2322 2331 2335              M1.7                                   
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field reached
minor to major storm levels with severe storms at high latitudes due
to continued effects from the 05 Oct CME. Unsettled to active
periods were observed from 09/1200-2100Z followed by another minor
storm period to end the day due to effects from a coronal hole high
speed wind stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
