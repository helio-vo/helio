THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 22 OCT
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
NONE
B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET
LEVELS THROUGH 22/0500Z. ACTIVITY INCREASED DURING THE REMAINDER OF
THE DAY WITH UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE LEVELS DETECTED AT MIDDLE LATITUDES
AND UNSETTLED TO MINOR STORM LEVELS DETECTED AT HIGH LATITUDES. THIS
