B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Quiet conditions prevailed before a shock impacted ACE at
03/0626Z.  This shock was likely associated with the filament
eruption and CME on 31 July. The impact was relatively weak with no
significant southward Bz, consequently, only isolated active periods
were observed.
