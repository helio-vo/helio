Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 148 Issued at 0245Z on 27 May 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None

(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W96 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence

F.  Comments:
The ACE spacecraft orbit will bring ACE nearly 
in line with the Sun from about May 30 to June 2, 
2004. During that time solar radio noise is 
expected to interfere with spacecraft telemetry 
resulting in the loss of solar wind plasma, 
magnetic field, and particle data.
