Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 278 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Oct 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1413 1423 1427  9644 N18W41 C2.4  Sf 190                           
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 01 October continued.  The peak flux for this event was 2360 pfu
at 02/0810 UTC.  The Flux levels remained above event level at the
time of bulletin issue and are gradually decreasing.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels due to CME passage.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
