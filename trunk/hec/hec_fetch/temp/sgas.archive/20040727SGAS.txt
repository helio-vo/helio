B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
yesterday at 25/1855Z, is still in progress.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to severe storm levels. The severe geomagnetic storm that
occurred yesterday, continued into the early hours of this period.
Major to severe geomagnetic storm periods were observed through
26/0300Z. Solar wind speed remained elevated from 500 to over 700
km/s, but IMF Bz was generally around zero from 0300 to 2228Z.
Consequently, the geomagnetic field was mostly quiet to unsettled. 
A strong shock impacted the ACE spacecraft at 26/2228Z.  A sudden
impulse (SI) of 96 Nt was observed on the Boulder magnetometer at
2251Z.  Major to severe storming ensued. This CME was associated
with the long-duration M1 flare at 25/1514Z. The CME made a very
fast Sun to Earth transit - just over 31 hours.
