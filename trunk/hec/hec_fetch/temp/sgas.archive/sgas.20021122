B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly at active to minor storm levels.  Isolated major storm
conditions were seen at all latitudes and a period of severe storm
levels were observed at high latitudes between 21/0600 to 0900 UTC. 
Elevated geomagnetic activity is in response to a favorably
positioned recurrent coronal hole.  The greater than 2 MeV electron
flux at geosynchronous orbit reached moderate levels today.
