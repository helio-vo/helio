Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 8.4e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.16e+09 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 Planetary 3 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit reached very high levels during the period.
Particle measurements were being reported from the GOES-15
spacecraft until approximately 05/1730Z when GOES-13 returned as the
primary particle monitor.
