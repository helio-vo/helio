B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly quiet, with an isolated unsettled period observed at
higher latitudes during 05/1800-2100 UTC.  The greater than 2 MeV
electron flux observed at geosynchronous orbit exceeded event
threshold again today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
