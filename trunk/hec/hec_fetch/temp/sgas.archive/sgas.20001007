Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 281 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Oct 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to unsettled.  Today's solar wind was characterized by
declining speeds, low densities, and weak, northwardly directed
magnetic fields, all of which lead to predominantly quiet
conditions.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
