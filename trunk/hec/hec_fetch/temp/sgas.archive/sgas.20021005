B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly active to major storm levels with an isolated severe
storm period between 04/00 - 03Z.  Though solar wind speed remains
below 450 km/s, the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic
field was sustained southward for the entire period, ranging -2 to
-12nT. The storm was gradually subsiding by the end of the period.
