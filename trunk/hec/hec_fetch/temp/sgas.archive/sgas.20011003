B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 01 October continued. The (preliminary) maximum flux for this
event was 2360 pfu at 02/0810 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV proton
flux was 131 pfu at the close of the period and was gradually
decreasing.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Field activity ranged from
unsettled to major storm levels. Major storm levels occurred during
02/0600 - 0900 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
