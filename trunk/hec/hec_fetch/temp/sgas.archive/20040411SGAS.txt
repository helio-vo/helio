Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 102 Issued at 0245Z on 11 Apr 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 10 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. Solar wind speed was in gradual decline following
yesterday's CME impact. Speed had declined from a peak near 570 km/s
at 09/0505Z to near 400 km/s late in the period. A sharp
discontinuity in solar wind plasma and IMF measurements occurred at
10/1925Z. This was likely the interplanetary shock associated with
the C7 flare and CME on 08 April. Solar wind speed following the
shock ranged from 500 to 540 km/s, but the IMF BZ was mostly
northward.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
