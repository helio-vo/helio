Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 361 Issued at 0245Z on 27 Dec 2013
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0655 0702 0707  1931 S16W23 C2.2  Sf 100                           
B.  Proton Events:  The 10MeV proton flux at geosynchronous orbit
became enhanced beginning around 26/0900Z due to a far-sided coronal
mass ejection first observed in STEREO-B imagery at 26/0410Z. A
maximum 10MeV proton flux level of 2 pfu was observed at 26/2125Z
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Quiet
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
