Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 300 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Oct 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  An enhancement in the greater than 10 MeV proton flux at
geosynchronous orbit began at approximately 1330 UTC.  The flux is
currently near 10 pfu.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
