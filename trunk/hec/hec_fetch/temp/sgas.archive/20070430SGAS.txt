Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 120 Issued at 0245Z on 30 Apr 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 29 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm conditions. Increased activity was due to the
continued influence of a recurrent coronal hole high speed stream.
Solar wind speed at ACE is currently elevated around 660 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
