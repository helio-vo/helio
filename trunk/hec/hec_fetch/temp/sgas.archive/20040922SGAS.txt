B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with an isolated active period between 0300Z to 0600Z. 
The active conditions followed a period of southward IMF Bz.  Solar
wind plasma and magnetic field measurements indicate the presence of
a weak coronal hole stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
