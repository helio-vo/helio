JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 134 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 13 MAY 2000
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 12 MAY
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT QUIET
TO MINOR STORM LEVELS.  ONE ISOLATED PERIOD OF MINOR STORM
CONDITIONS WAS OBSERVED FROM 12/0600 - 0900Z.  DATA FROM THE ACE
SPACECRAFT INDICATED THE PASSAGE OF TWO SOLAR TRANSIENTS, ASSUMED TO
BE RELATED TO THE MULTIPLE FILAMENT ERUPTIONS OF 8 MAY.  WHILE THE
TRANSIENTS PRODUCED SUSTAINED PERIODS OF NEGATIVE BZ, THE SOLAR WIND
SPEED REMAINED VERY LOW, INHIBITING A STRONG GEOMAGNETIC REPONSE.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE
