Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 077 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Mar 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists stratwarm Saturday
The circulation in the lower stratosphere remains
disturbed as a result of the major warming.  The
reversed temperature gradient persists up to 20 hpa.
In the middle and upper stratosphere, the vortex 
weakens and becomes less distorted.  Slow transition
to summer conditions most probable.
