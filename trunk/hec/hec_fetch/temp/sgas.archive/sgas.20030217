Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 048 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Coronal hole effects continue with solar wind
gradually increasing to near 650 km/s and Bz continuing to be, on
average, slightly southward.  Major storming conditions were
observed at higher latitudes.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/SUNDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
STRONG WAVE TWO CIRCULATION PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE STRATOSPHERE. 
REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE NORTH POLE FROM 30
HPA UP TO 1 HPA AND EASTERLY ZONAL MEAN WINDS AT 1 AND 2 HPA. 
EASTERLY ZONAL MEAN WINDS AT 60N EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE UPPER
STRATOSPHERE WITHIN THE NEXT DAYS AS WELL AS A REVERSED TEMPERATURE
GRADIENT THROUGHOUT THE STRATOSPHERE.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
