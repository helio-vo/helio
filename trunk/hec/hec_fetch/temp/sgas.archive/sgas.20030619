Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 170 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Jun 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 2227 2255 2312  0386        M6.8     1200   2100   II/IV           
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 Mev proton fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit reached event threshold at 18/2050Z and due to
the recent activity the exact source for this particle event is not
certain at this time but is most likely from the M6.8 x-ray flare
from 17 June..
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly minor to major storm levels with an isolated period of
severe storm conditions seen at high latitudes between 18/0600 and
0900Z.  A co-rotating integrated region preceding a recurrent high
speed coronal hole stream and is believed to responsible for the
storm conditions.

K-Indices:
On 16 June, it was determined that a scaling problem exists with the Boulder magnetometer instrument.  While this problem, and its fix are being investigated the primary instrument for Boulder K-indices has been switched to the Boulder USGS (via Domsat) magnetometer, effective 1500 UTC on 16 June.

GOES Protons:
To ensure continued operational monitoring of important energetic particle data, it is necessary to reassign primary/secondary designations for the GOES Space Environment Monitor (SEM) detectors. GOES 11 (113W) will become the primary satellite for protons. The transition from GOES 8 to GOES 11 was scheduled for 18 June, but has been delayed until 19 June. GOES 12 will continue as the primary satellite for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements. GOES 10 (135W) will be the secondary satellite for all SEM sensors - magnetometer, X-ray, and energetic particles.  Because of the degraded state of the proton data on GOES-10, its designation as the secondary source for proton data is a short-term solution.  More permanent solutions have been identified and are being evaluated.  Users will be notified when we define and schedule a permanent fix.
