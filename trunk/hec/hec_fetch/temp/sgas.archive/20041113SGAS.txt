Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 318 Issued at 0245Z on 13 Nov 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 Nov
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event continues.
The proton event began on 07/1910Z following the X2 flare on
07/1606Z. The peak was 495 pfu at 08/0115Z and the current flux is
ranging between 12 - 20 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels with major storm periods at high
latitudes. This disturbance is due to the CME activity on 09 and 10
November. Solar wind speed ranged from 550 to over 700 km/s, but was
trending down during the latter half of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
