Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 228 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Aug 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been
mainly quiet, with isolated unsettled periods.  Greater than 2 MeV
electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached moderate enhancement
levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 147  SSN 155  Afr/Ap 007/009   X-ray Background B4.8
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 5.2e+05   GT 10 MeV 3.4e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.30e+07 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 2 2 2 1 2 3 2 2 Planetary 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 
F.  Comments:  Afr estimated from Boulder A.  At product issue time,
a 100 MeV proton event is in early stages of development.  Solar
source of this activity is not presently known, but is likely from a
backside event behind the west limb.
