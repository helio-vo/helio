F.  Comments:  This message is for users of the NOAA/SEC Space 
Weather Operations sunspot region numbers. As you 
may have noticed, we are steadily approaching 
region number 10000. The plan for Space Weather 
operations is to go through the sequence of Region 
numbers as 9998, 9999, 0000, 0001, and so on. SEC's 
product text discussions of the active regions 
will ignore the leading zeroes (for example, we 
will say 'Region number 5' rather than Region 
number '0005'). However, the Geoalert product, the 
Region Report product, as well as the USAF and IUWDS 
data exchange codes will preserve the 4 digit format. 
The necessity of using four digits is for operational 
purposes only. For historical purposes all regions 
beyond Region 9999 will be understood to be in a 
series of regions numbers 10000 and higher.
