Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 079 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Mar 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1106 1144 1231  9866 S10W58 M1.0  1f                               
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event remains in
progress, with a maximum flux of 53 pfu observed at 19/0650 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels  Minor storm levels were observed early in the
day, due to a three hour period of sustained southward Bz during
0200-0500 UTC.
