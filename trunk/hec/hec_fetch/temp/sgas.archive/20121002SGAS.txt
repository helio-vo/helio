SGAS Number 276 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Oct 2012
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Oct

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field started the
day at severe storm levels at high latitudes with major storms
observed at mid-latitudes. The activity was due to the arrival of
the 28 September CME. Activity decreased to mostly quiet levels
during the remainder of the day.
