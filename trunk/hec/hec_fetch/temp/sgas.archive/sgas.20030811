Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 223 Issued at 0245Z on 11 Aug 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 10 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. A declining high speed stream with very low density and weak
northward IMF Bz continues to buffet the Earth's magnetic field.
Solar wind speed declined from near 700 km/s to below 600 km/s by
the end of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
