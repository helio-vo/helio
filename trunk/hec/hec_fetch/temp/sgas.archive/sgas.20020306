Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 065 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Mar 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Mar

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field activity was
at quiet to active levels.  High speed stream effects of a large,
recurrent coronal hole remains geoeffective.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM TUESDAY
THROUGHOUT THE STRATOSPHERE STILL DISTURBED CONDITIONS AFTER THE
WARMING. THE TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE POLE AND 60 N IS STILL
REVERSED IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE STRATOSPHERE.
