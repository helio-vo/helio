Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 024 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Jan 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  An isolated period of minor storming occurred at
the Boulder magnetometer between 23/0900 and 1200Z.  The elevated
conditions are due to a recurrent high speed coronal hole stream. 
The solar wind speeds increased from near 400 km/sec to over 600
km/sec, between 23/0600 and 1200Z.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
