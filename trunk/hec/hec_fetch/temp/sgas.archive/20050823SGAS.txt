Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 235 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Aug 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux passed the 10
pfu event threshold at 22/2040 UTC. The flux at 23/0000 UTC was
about 88 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active periods. This activity is believed to
be the result of a high-speed coronal hole stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

F.  Comments:  Today's observed Penticton 10.7 flux was flare
enhanced. The daily background value reported in Part E was
estimated to be 105 sfu.
