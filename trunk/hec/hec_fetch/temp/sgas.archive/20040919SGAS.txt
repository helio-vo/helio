Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 263 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Sep 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels with a period of major storming between
18/0000 - 0300Z. The storm levels were in response to a prolonged
period of southward IMF Bz and solar wind speeds near 500 km/s. The
geomagnetic field was predominantly quiet to end the period as the
solar wind speed declined to 400 km/s and IMF Bz was sustained
north.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
