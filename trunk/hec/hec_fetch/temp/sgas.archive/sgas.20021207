Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 341 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  A sector boundary crossing and coronal hole
effects were observed late in the day by the NASA/ACE spacecraft. 
At about 06/1630 UTC solar wind velocity increased to near 410 km/s
and continues a gradual rise.  Greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geo-synchronous orbit reached high levels for the eighth straight
day.  GOES-8 values reached 8230 pfu today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
