Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 357 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Dec 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet, with a single period of unsettled conditions observed during
the interval 21/0900-1200Z.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM THURSDAY
STRONG STRATOSPHERIC MINOR WARMING CONTINUES.  A SPLIT
VORTEX IN THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE EXISTS WITH THE MAIN CENTER
OVER CANADA AND A MINOR CENTER WEST OF THE BAIKAL SEA
WEAKENING.  A WARM ANTICYCLONE IS LOCATED OVER THE 
NORWEGEAN SEA WITH THE WARM AIR OVER THE BARENTS SEA.
AT 5 AND 10 HPA A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT EXISTS
BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE.  MEAN ZONAL WIND IS VERY 
WEAK FROM THE WEST IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE.
