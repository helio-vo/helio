Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 320 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Nov 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Quiet conditions were predominant until a small sudden
impulse (SI) of 6 nT was observed on the Boulder magnetometer at
15/1509Z. Unsettled to active conditions prevailed since the SI.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
