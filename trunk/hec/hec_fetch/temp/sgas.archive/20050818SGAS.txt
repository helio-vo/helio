Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 230 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Aug 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
unsettled to active. Solar wind speed at ACE has been variable
between approximately 600 km/s to 750 km/s due to the continued
influence of a coronal hole high speed stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
