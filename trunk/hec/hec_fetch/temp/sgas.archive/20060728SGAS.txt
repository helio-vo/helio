Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 209 Issued at 0245Z on 28 Jul 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 27 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet.
Solar wind speed increased gradually from 330 km/s to near 550 km/s
by the end of the period. This increase is associated with a high
speed coronal hole stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
