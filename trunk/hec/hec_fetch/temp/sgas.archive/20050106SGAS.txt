Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 006 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Jan 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to minor storm levels. Solar wind speed began the period
near 750 km/s, but gradually declined to near 600 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
