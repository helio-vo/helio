B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event and
associated polar cap absorption remained in progress at the end of
the period (proton flux peaked to 18900 pfu at 24/0555 UTC).
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels with an isolated period of active
(24/2100-25/0000 UTC).    A moderate (10.2 percent based on the
Thule neutron monitor) Forbush decrease began shortly after the
beginning of forecast period and peaked near 25/0040 UTC, ended near
25/0300 UTC.
