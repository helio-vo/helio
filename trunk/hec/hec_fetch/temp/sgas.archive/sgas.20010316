B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity was at
quiet levels throughout the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  stratwarm alert exists stratwarm thursday
as a result of the major warming, the circulation
on the lower stratosphere remains further disturbed
leading to a reversed temperature gradient up to
20 hpa.  in the middle and upper stratosphere, the
cold and elongated vortex weakens.  slow transition
to summer conditions most probable.
