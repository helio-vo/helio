Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 090 Issued at 0245Z on 31 Mar 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active with isolated minor storm periods at high
latitudes. Solar wind signatures early this period indicate a
transition from transient flow to a high speed coronal hole stream.
Solar wind speed began the period near 400 km/s, but gradually
increased to near 650 km/s by end of period.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT / SUNDAY / STRATWARM EXISTS
A LARGE WARM REGION OVER ASIA INTENSIFIES AND MOVES POLEWARDS WHILE
THE COLD REGION WEAKENS, INDICATING THE BEGINNING OF THE FINAL
WARMING.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
