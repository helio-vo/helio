B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to minor storm levels.  Two periods of minor storming
occurred one at 04/0600 UTC and another at 04/1200 UTC.  Solar wind
speeds have been sustained at around 750 km/s throughout the last 24
hours.  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes were at high levels
during the past 24 hours.
