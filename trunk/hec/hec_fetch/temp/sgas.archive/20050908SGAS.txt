Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 251 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Sep 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Sep

B.  Proton Events:  A slow rise in the greater than 10 and greater
than 100 MeV protons at geosynchronous orbit began late in the
period. The greater than 10 MeV protons will likely cross the 10 pfu
threshold on 08 Sep.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Today's powerful X17 flare produced a sudden disturbance in
the geomagnetic field at 07/1725Z. This 82 nT magnetic crochet was
one of the largest observed this Solar Cycle.
