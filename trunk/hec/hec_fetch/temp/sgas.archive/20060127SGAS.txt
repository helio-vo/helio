Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 027 Issued at 0245Z on 27 Jan 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to major storm levels. An isolated major storm period was observed
between 26/1500 UTC and 26/1800 UTC. The heightened activity was due
to the influence of a high speed coronal hole stream.
