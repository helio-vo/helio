Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 027 Issued at 0245Z on 27 Jan 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Elevated solar wind speed near 700 km/s combined
with a Bz near negative 5 nT resulted in active conditions.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/SUNDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS 
DISTURBED WAVE NUMBER TWO PATTERN OF THE CIRCULATION AND OF THE
TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION.  WARM AIR COVERS THE POLAR REGION IN THE
MIDDLE STRATOSPHERE LEADING TO A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT
BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE FROM 20HPA UPWARDS.
