Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 165 Issued at 0245Z on 14 Jun 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to major storm conditions. A period of major storming
conditions was observed at 13/0300 - 0600 UTC. Heightened activity
was due to a prolonged southward Bz in response to CME activity from
08 June. By the end of the period, conditions had quieted down to
unsettled levels and the Bz component of the Magnetic field did not
vary beyond +/- 5 nT.
