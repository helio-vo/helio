B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux crossed the
10 pfu event threshold at 07/0440 UTC after a slow rise over the
previous 28 hours. Peak event flux so far was 208 pfu at 07/1650
UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to severe storm levels. A shock in the solar wind was observed
by the NASA ACE spacecraft at 07/1609 UTC and was followed by a 7 nT
sudden impulse on the Boulder magnetometer at 07/1638 UTC.
