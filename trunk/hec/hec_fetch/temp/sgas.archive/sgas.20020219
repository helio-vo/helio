B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Activity ranged from quiet to
active levels. An active period occurred during 18/2100-2400 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists Stratwarm Monday
The criteria for a major warming are fulfilled. There are mean zonal
easterly winds at 60N from the 10 HPA level upwards and a reversed
temperature gradient between 60N and the pole from 50 HPA up to 1
HPA.
