B.  Proton Events:  Particle fluxes for >10MeV protons were enhanced,
but remained below event thresholds.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.  High speed stream effects from a favorably positioned
coronal hole appeared to wane, with falling solar wind velocities
over the course of the period.  Particle fluxes for >2MeV electrons
were enhanced, but remained below event thresholds.
