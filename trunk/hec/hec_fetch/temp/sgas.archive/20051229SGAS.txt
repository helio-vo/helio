Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 363 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Dec 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.  A recurrent trans-equatorial high
speed coronal hole stream was responsible for the elevated
conditions.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
