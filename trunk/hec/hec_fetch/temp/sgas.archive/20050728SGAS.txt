Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 209 Issued at 0245Z on 28 Jul 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 27 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
B.  Proton Events:  A slow gradual rise in the greater than 10 MeV
protons began after the M3.7 event at 27/0502 UTC.  The 10 pfu alert
threshold was finally reached at 27/2300 UTC.  The max flux at the
time of issue for the greater than 10 MeV was 14 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
minor storm conditions.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
