Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 213 Issued at 0245Z on 31 Jul 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 Jul
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  A shock passage was observed at the ACE
spacecraft at approximately 30/2030Z and is believed to be in
response to the very long duration C4 x-ray flare that occurred at
28/0609Z.  A sudden impulse of 25 nT occurred at the Boulder
magnetometer at 30/2115Z.
