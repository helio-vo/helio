B.  Proton Events:  A proton event at greater than 10 MeV began at
16/0210 UTC in response to an X2 flare which occurred at 15/2302
UTC. Peak flux observed so far was 365 pfu at 16/1840 UTC. The event
remains in progress.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels.
