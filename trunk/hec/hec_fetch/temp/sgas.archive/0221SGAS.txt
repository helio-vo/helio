Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 052 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Feb 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels.  An enhancement of the solar wind speed
occurred near 20/1000Z (400 km/sec to 550/ km/sec) due to a
geoeffective coronal hole.  A brief period of major storm levels
occurred at higher latitudes between 20/1500 and 1800Z.
