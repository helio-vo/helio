Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 340 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Dec 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.  A ten hour period of southward Bz,
together with solar wind speed near 475 km/s produced minor storm
levels for most of the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
