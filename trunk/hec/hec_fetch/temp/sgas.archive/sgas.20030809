Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 221 Issued at 0245Z on 09 Aug 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 08 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
active to major storm levels.  Periods of southward Bz near - 8 nT
produced major and minor storm periods early in the day.  Solar wind
speed increased from 600 km/s to near 800 km/s at 0600 Z and has
remained elevated.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
