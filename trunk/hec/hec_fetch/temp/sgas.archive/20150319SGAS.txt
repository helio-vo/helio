Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 078 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Mar 2015
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Minor storm levels were recorded
for the first period. Activity decreased briefly below storm levels
with an active period followed by an unsettled period before
returning to minor storming levels. Moderate storming levels were
observed for the next periods followed by a period of minor storming
levels and ending the period in active conditions.
