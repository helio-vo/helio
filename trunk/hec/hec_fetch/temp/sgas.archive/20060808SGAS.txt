Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 220 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Aug 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to major storm conditions. Activity was due to a solar
sector boundary crossing followed by a coronal hole high speed
stream.
