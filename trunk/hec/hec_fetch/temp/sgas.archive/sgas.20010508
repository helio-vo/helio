Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field varied from
quiet to minor storm levels. A prolonged period of southward IMF,
from approximately 06/2200-07/0800 UTC, spawned active to minor
storm conditions at mid and high latitudes. Quiet to unsettled
conditions developed after 07/0900 UTC.  A greater than 10 MeV
proton event began at 07/1915 UTC, in response to flares and CME
activity observed during 07/1000-1200 UTC.  The event remains in
progress, with a maximum greater than 10 MeV flux observed thus far
of 27 pfu at 07/2315 UTC.
