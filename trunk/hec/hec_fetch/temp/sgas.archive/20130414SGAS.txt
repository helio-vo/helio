B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV protons at geosynchronous
orbit continue to be enhanced near 2.4 pfu but remain below the 10
pfu threshold.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled.  A geomagnetic sudden impulse was observed in the
Boulder magnetometer at 13/2255Z (29 nT) associated with the shock
arrival from the 11 April CME.
