C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  Greater than 2 MeV electrons at
geo-synchronous orbit reached high levels today.

F.  Comments:  Beginning 1500 UTC April 8, SEC will begin using data
from the GOES 12 satellite, and stop receiving GOES 8 data. GOES 12
has the new Solar X-Ray Imager (SXI), which will acquire real-time,
operational images of the solar x-ray flux. With the switch from
GOES 8 to GOES 12, the primary/secondary designations will change.
GOES 12 will be the primary satellite for the SXI. All other data,
including magnetometer, XRS x-ray measurements, and energetic
particles, will have GOES 10 as their primary source, with GOES 12
as the secondary source where available. Please see
http://www.sec.noaa.gov/GOES.html for important information on this
changeover.
