Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 074 Issued at 0245Z on 14 Mar 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 Mar

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active. The high speed coronal hole stream that produced
several minor storm periods in recent days is now subsiding. Solar
wind speed decreased to below 500 km/s by the end of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 104  SSN 061  Afr/Ap 013/015   X-ray Background B1.4
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.1e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.2e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W99 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 7.40e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels today.
