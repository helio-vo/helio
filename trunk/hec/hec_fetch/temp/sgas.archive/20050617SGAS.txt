Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 168 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Jun 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Jun
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 100 and greater than 10 MeV proton
event began at 16/2125 and 16/2200 UTC respectively.  The greater
than 100 MeV peak flux so far is 2.9 pfu; the greater than 10 MeV
peak flux so far is 34 pfu.  The event was still in progress at time
of issue.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels.  Transient material associated with the
CME activity on 14 June impacted the ACE spacecraft at approximately
16/0830 UTC. A short-lived period of southward IMF Bz to near -16 nT
resulted in a major storm from 0900 to 1200 UTC.  The period ended
with unsettled to active levels.
