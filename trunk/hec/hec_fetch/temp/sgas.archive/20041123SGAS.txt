SGAS Number 328 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Nov 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  Isolated active periods were observed at mid latitudes
between 0600 to 0900 UTC, and high latitudes between 0300 to 0900
UTC.  Solar wind speed has declined from 600 km/s to 500 km/s during
this reporting period.
