B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels. Solar wind speeds increased up to around 600
km/s at 02/2300 UTC, but dropped down to 500-550 km/s from 0100-1900
UTC. However, there appears to be another solar wind speed increase
in progress at this time.  The greater than 2 MeV fluence at
geosynchronous orbit reached moderate levels today.
