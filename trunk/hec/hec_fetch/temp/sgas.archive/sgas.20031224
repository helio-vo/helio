Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 358 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Dec 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Dec
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. The coronal hole high speed stream that began on 21
December, has now rotated out of a geoeffective position. Solar wind
speed declined from a maximum of near 650 km/s on 22 December, to
approximately 500 km/s at the end of this period.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/TUESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS
INTENSE WARMING OVER SIBERIA/EUROPE CONTINUES AND INTENSIFIES AT THE
10-HPA LEVEL DURING THE NEXT FIVE DAYS.  TEMPERATURE GRADIENT
REVERSED FROM 10 HPA UPWARDS.
