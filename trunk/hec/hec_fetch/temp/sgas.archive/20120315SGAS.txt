B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 100 MeV event that began at
13/1810Z, reached a peak value of 1 pfu at 13/1905Z, and ended at
13/2255Z The 10 MeV proton event greater than 100 pfu (S2-Moderate)
event began at 13/1855Z, reached a peak value of 469 pfu at
13/2045Z, and dropped below 100 pfu into S1-Minor threshold at
14/0955Z.  The S1-Minor storming level remains in progress as of the
close of this period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Field activity was mostly quiet to
unsettled in the mid latitudes with periods of active levels at high
latitudes.
