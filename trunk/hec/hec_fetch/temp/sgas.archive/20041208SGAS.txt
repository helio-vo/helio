Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 343 Issued at 0245Z on 08 Dec 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 07 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  A period of minor storm conditions did occur at
high latitudes between 07/0300 and 0600Z and is believed to be in
response to a waning coronal hole.
