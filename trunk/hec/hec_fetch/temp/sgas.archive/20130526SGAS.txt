B.  Proton Events:  The Proton Event 10MeV Integral Flux exceeded
10pfu which began 22/1420Z,
reached a maximum of 1660 pfu on
23/0650Z, and fell below the 10 pfu threshold at  25/0845Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
active to major storm levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
