Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 348 Issued at 0245Z on 13 Dec 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly quiet throughout the day.  A single unsettled period
was observed at Boulder during 1500-1800 UTC.  The greater-than-2
MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit was elevated at moderate
levels (above 1000 pfu) during local daytime hours.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/TUESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
MAJOR WARMING CONTINUES.  5 AND 8-DAY FORECASTS
INDICATE A VORTEX SPLITTING EVENT TO FORM TWO NEW
CENTRES OVER THE CANADIAN ARCTIC AND A WEAKER
CENTRE OVER SIBERIA.  THE WARM AIR OVER SIBERIA AND
RUSSIA COOLS SLIGHTLY AND SPREADS TO THE WEST.
