Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 352 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Dec 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active levels late in the period.  A gradual
increase in solar wind speed began about 16/0500Z.  Speed increased
from near 350 km/s to 600 km/s by the end of the day.  This is
likely the onset of a recurrent high speed stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
