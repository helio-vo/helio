B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV event at geosynchronous
orbit that began at 25/1355Z in the wake of the Feb 25 X4/2b flare
continued, with a peak flux of 23 pfu (S1 - Minor) observed at
26/0010Z. Greater than 10 MeV flux levels leveled off in the high
teens during the period with no significant decay evident. The X4
flare-associated greater than 100 MeV flux enhancement at
geosynchronous orbit (peak 0.9 pfu at 25/1945Z) also continued and
gradually decayed toward background levels.
