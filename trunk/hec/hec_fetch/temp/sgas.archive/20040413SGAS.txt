Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 104 Issued at 0245Z on 13 Apr 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 Apr

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 11/1135Z, peaked at 35 pfu at 11/1845Z, and ended at 12/0405Z. 
This proton event is likely to be associated with the C9 flare that
occurred at 11/0419Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  A shock passage was observed at the ACE
spacecraft at approximately 12/1730Z and it is believed to be in
response to the partial halo CME that was associated with the C2
flare that occurred on 09/2040Z.  Once again, the IMF Bz remained
predominantly northward and the geomagnetic response was weak. 
Solar wind speeds peaked at near 540 km/s shortly after the shock
passage.
