Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 151 Issued at 0245Z on 31 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 May

B.  Proton Events:  The proton event at greater than 10 MeV has
ended: 28/2335 UTC start, 121 pfu peak at 29/1530 UTC, and 30/0110
UTC end.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to severe storm levels. The field was mostly unsettled to
active since about 30/0600 UTC with a single minor storm period from
30/1500-1800 UTC. The CME associated with the X1 flare early on 29
May was apparently observed to encounter the ACE spacecraft at about
30/1600 UTC. The shock in solar wind parameters was not strong and
an SI was not clearly observed by ground magnetometers.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
