Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 109 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Apr 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Apr

B.  Proton Events:  Yesterday's greater than 10 MeV proton event has
ended: start 17/1530 UTC, maximum flux (24 pfu) 17/1540 UTC, and end
18/0035 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to severe storm levels in response to the CME that impacted
the Earth early on 17 April. ACE solar wind information suggests
that this CME has passed.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
