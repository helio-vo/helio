Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 198 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Jul 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Jul

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 14/0245Z, had a peak flux of 134 pfu at 15/0345Z, remains
in-progress.  The proton flux has been on a gradual decrease and was
near 10 pfu at the end of the period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly quiet to unsettled levels.  An active period occurred
at the Boulder magnetometer between 16/0600 and 0900Z.  A weak
transient signature was observed at the ACE spacecraft near 16/0100Z
with no significant geomagnetic effects resulting.
