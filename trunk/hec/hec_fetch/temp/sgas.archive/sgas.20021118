Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 322 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Nov 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Nov
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled conditions.  NASA/ACE spacecraft indicates the possible
development of a transient shock.  A sharp rise in low energy
protons (EPAM instrument) was observed early on 17 November to near
10^4 pfu.
