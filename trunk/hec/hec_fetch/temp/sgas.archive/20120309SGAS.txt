B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 100 MeV proton event at
geosynchronous orbit that began at 07/0405Z, reached a maximum of 69
pfu at 07/1525Z, and was in progress at the close of the period. The
greater than 10 MeV proton event that began at 07/0510Z, reached a
maximum of 6530 pfu at 08/1115Z, and was in progress at the close of the
period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity ranged
from quiet to major storm levels. Activity increased from quiet
levels to active to major storm levels following a geomagnetic
sudden impulse at 08/1105Z (59 nT, Boulder USGS magnetometer).
