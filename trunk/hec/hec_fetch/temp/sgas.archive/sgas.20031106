Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 310 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Nov 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0237 0241 0245  0486 S19W89 M1.6  Sf

B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event from the X28
flare began at 04/2225Z, reached a peak value of 353 pfu at
05/0600Z, and is currently in progress, but declining.  A greater
than 100 MeV proton event began at 05/0535Z, reached a peak value of
1.3 pfu at 05/0540Z, and ended at 05/0705Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 114  SSN 032  Afr/Ap 008/009   X-ray Background C1.2
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 9.3e+07   GT 10 MeV 1.2e+07 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W107 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 3.90e+06 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 2 0 1 0 1 2 3 3 Planetary 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 
F.  Comments:  The GOES EPS instrument for greater than 2 MeV
electron measurement at geosynchronous orbit is exhibiting proton
contamination at this time, making the 2 MeV electron fluence data
unreliable.
