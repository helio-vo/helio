SGAS Number 185 Issued at 0245Z on 03 Jul 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 02 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 081  SSN 033  Afr/Ap 008/009   X-ray Background A3.4
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 3.7e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.3e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W96 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was moderate. The Afr index reported in Part E
is estimated from Boulder observations.
