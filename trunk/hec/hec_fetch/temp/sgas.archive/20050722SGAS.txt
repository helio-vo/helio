Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 203 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Jul 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.  Mid and high lattitudes experienced
minor storming from 0000 to 0600 UTC, with high lattitudes
experiencing further minor storming from 0900 to 1200 UTC.  The
storm conditions are the result of a coronal hole high speed stream.
Solar wind speed has been at about 550 km/s thoughout the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
