Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 081 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Mar 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  Isolated active periods were due to continued effects of a
coronal hole high speed stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 077  SSN 039  Afr/Ap 012/013   X-ray Background A3.2
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.4e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.5e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W104 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.10e+09 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 3 4 1 3 3 3 3 3 Planetary 3 4 1 1 3 3 3 3 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit reached very high levels.
