Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 083 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Mar 2015
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.  An isolated minor storm period was
observed during the 23/0300-0600 UTC period due to elevated solar
wind velocities and a slightly extended period of negative Bz.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
