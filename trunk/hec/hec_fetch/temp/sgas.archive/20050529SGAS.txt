Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 149 Issued at 0245Z on 29 May 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Active periods are due to the effects of a recurrent coronal
hole high speed stream. At approximately 28/0330 UTC a Co-rotating
Interaction Region (CIR) was observed at ACE preceding the coronal
hole high speed stream. Solar wind speed at ACE increased from
approximately 275 km/s to 550 km/s and decreased slightly to around
420 km/s.
