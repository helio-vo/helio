Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 151 Issued at 0245Z on 31 May 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 May

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
satellite hinted that a weak shock passage occurred at approximately
30/0030 UTC, with unsettled conditions following.  This was believed
to be from the disappearing filament from 27 May.
