Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 329 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Nov 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0356 0356 0357                       300                           
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active periods in the higher latitudes. A
well positioned coronal hole is producing solar wind speeds near 600
km/s, creating a weak disturbance in the geomagnetic field.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
