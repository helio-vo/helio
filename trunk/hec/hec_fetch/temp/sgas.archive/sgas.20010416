B.  Proton Events:  Solar proton events at greater than 100 MeV and
greater than 10 MeV followed the X14 flare. The greater than 100 MeV
event began at 15/1405 UTC, reached a maximum of 146 PFU at 15/1525
UTC, then gradually decreased to 12 PFU by the close of the period.
The greater than 10 MeV event began at 15/1410 UTC and reached a
maximum of 951 PFU at 15/1920 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV flux was
551 PFU at the close of the period and slowly decreasing.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Activity ranged from quiet to
active levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
