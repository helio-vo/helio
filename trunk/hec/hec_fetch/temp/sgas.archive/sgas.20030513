Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 133 Issued at 0245Z on 13 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
unsettled to minor storm levels due to a continued high speed solar
wind stream.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous
altitude reached high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
