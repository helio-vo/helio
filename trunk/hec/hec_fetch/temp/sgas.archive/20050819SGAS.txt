Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 231 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Aug 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active due to the continued influence of a coronal hole high speed
stream. Solar wind speed at ACE has gradually decreased from
approximately 700 km/s to 620 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
