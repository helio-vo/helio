Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 243 Issued at 0245Z on 30 Aug 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 29 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet to unsettled levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 086  SSN 036  Afr/Ap 004/008   X-ray Background A5.8
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 5.5e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.4e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W98 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 4.60e+07 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)

F.  Comments:  The ACE spacecraft orbit will bring ACE to its closest
approach with the Sun on August 30, 2004. During that time possible
solar radio noise may interfere with spacecraft telemetry resulting
in the loss of real time solar wind plasma, magnetic field, and
particle data.
