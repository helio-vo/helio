Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 284 Issued at 0245Z on 11 Oct 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 10 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  Greater than 10 MeV proton flux at geosynchronous
orbit remained at elevated levels but below the proton event
threshold of 10 pfu.

unsettled.  High speed coronal hole flow diminished throughout the
day.
