Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 049 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  Coronal hole effects continue to keep solar
wind elevated between 600 and 650 km/s and Bz continues to be, on
average, slightly negative.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/MONDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
Wave two circulation pattern throughout the stratosphere with a
reversed temperature gradient between 60N and the north pole
throughout the stratosphere and easterly zonal mean winds at 1 and 2
hpa. 5-day forecast shows a recovery of the circulation towards
almost normal winter conditions.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
