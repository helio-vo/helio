B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet to unsettled levels at middle latitudes.  Quiet to active
conditions were seen at the high latitudes.  ACE satellite data
suggests a solar sector boundary crossing may have been responsible
for the elevated field activity at the higher latitudes.
