Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 334 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Nov 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 24/1520Z, reaching a high value of 942 pfu at 26/2030, was just
above event threshold at 11.1 pfu as the period ended.  Levels are
expected to continue to steadily drop throughout the next 24 hours.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field began at
mostly unsettled levels, rose steadily to minor storm levels at
middle latitudes and major storm levels at high latitudes through
most of the middle of the period, before decreasing back to
mostly unsettled levels by the end of the reporting period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
