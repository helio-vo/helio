Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 139 Issued at 0245Z on 18 May 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 111  SSN 147  Afr/Ap 005/005   X-ray Background B2.3
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.2e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.4e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W97 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.20e+06 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 Planetary 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 2 
F.  Comments:  The ACE spacecraft orbit will bring ACE nearly in line
with the Sun from about 30 May  to 02 June, 2004. During that time
solar radio noise is expected to interfere with spacecraft telemetry
resulting in the loss of solar wind plasma, magnetic field, and
particle data.
