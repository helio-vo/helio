Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 096 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Apr 2010
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to severe storm levels during the past 24 hours. Conditions
were initially quiet to unsettled, but increased to active levels
after 0300Z, and increased further to major to severe storm levels
between 0900-1200Z.  Activity declined to active to major storm
levels from 1200-1800Z and declined further to mostly quiet to
unsettled levels from 1800-2400Z.
