Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 234 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Aug 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active. ACE real time solar wind data suggests the onset of
a coronal hole high speed stream at about 21/1530 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
