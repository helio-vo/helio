B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to active levels.  Elevated solar wind speeds and periods
of sustained southward Bz allowed for the observed intervals of
isolated active conditions.  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes
at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels today.
