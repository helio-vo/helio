B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to major storming levels.  A magnetic storm gradually
commenced after 04/0000 UTC, and sustained negative Bz resulted in
minor and isolated major storm periods through 04/1500 UTC. 
Conditions abated to active and unsettled levels for the reminder of
the day.
