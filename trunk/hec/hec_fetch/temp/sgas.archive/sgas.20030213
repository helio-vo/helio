Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 044 Issued at 0245Z on 13 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 12 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  A single isolated active period was observed
at higher latitudes between 12/1500 to 1800Z.  The greater than 2
MeV electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels
again today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/WEDNESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATOSPHERE SLIGHTLY DISTURBED TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION WITH A WARM REGION OVER SIBERIA, LEADING TO A REVERSED
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE FROM 5 TO 1 HPA
