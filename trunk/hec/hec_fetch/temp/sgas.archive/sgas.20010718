Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 199 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Jul 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly unsettled to active, with isolated quiet periods
observed at lower latitudes in the latter portion of the day.  Solar
wind speeds reached 600 to 700 km/s due to high-speed streaming from
a recurrent coronal hole.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 7.7e+04   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
