Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 177 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Jun 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  Showing weak geoeffective consequences, the
recurrent high speed coronal hole stream has pushed the solar winds
speeds to over 600 km/sec.  The Bz component of the interplanetary
magnetic field has been predominantly north throughout the period.
