JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 219 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 06 AUG 2000
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 05 AUG
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
 1752 1753 1755                       110                           
B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD RANGED FROM
QUIET TO MAJOR STORM LEVELS.  THE DAY BEGAN WITH QUIET TO UNSETTLED
CONDITIONS.  A SINGLE PERIOD OF MAJOR STORMING WAS OBSERVED AT
BOULDER DURING 05/0600-0900Z, WITH MORE EXTENSIVE MINOR STORMING
OBSERVED AT HIGHER LATITUDES DURING 05/0600-1200Z.  THE REMAINDER OF
THE DAY SAW UNSETTLED TO ACTIVE CONDITIONS.  THE ENHANCED ACTIVITY
IS ATTRIBUTED TO INCREASING SOLAR WIND SPEEDS, WHICH BEGAN RISING
AROUND 05/0800Z FROM 450 KM/S TO NEAR 600 KM/S BY 05/1000Z, AND
SUBSEQUENT SUSTAINED PERIODS OF NEGATIVE BZ NEAR -10 NT.
