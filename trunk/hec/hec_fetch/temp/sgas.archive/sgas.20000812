JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 225 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 12 AUG 2000
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 11 AUG
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
 0626 0626 0627                       100                           
 0635 0640 0644                       200

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  A SATELLITE PROTON EVENT AT GREATER THAN 10 MEV
BEGAN AT 1650Z. THIS VERY SMALL EVENT REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 17 PFU AT
1655Z AND ENDED AT 1740Z. A SMALL PCA OF APPROXIMATELY 2.0 DB
OCCURRED AT THULE CONCURRENT WITH THE PROTON EVENT. THE SOLAR SOURCE
OF THE PARTICLES IS AS YET UNDETERMINED.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT
UNSETTLED TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS. A PROLONGED PERIOD OF STEADY
SOUTHWARD IMF LASTING MORE THAN 24 HOURS FUELED THE DISTURBANCE. THE
BZ MAGNITUDE WAS NEARLY CONSTANT NEAR 10 NT. AT APPROXIMATELY 1800Z,
A SHOCK PASSED ACE AND ENDED THE NEAR STEADY-STATE OF THE SOLAR
WIND. THE SOLAR WIND SPEED AND DENSITY WERE QUITE AVERAGE PRIOR TO
THE SHOCK, BUT ATTAINED VALUES NEAR 600 KM/S, AND 10 P/CC AFTER.
THIS TRANSIENT MAY BE RELATED TO THE HALO CME OF 09 AUGUST.
