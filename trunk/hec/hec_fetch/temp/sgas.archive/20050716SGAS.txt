B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 14/0245Z, had a peak flux of 134 pfu at 15/0345Z. The proton flux
gradually decreased to near 50 pfu by the end of the period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet.
Solar wind speed declined to near 400 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
