Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 317 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Nov 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 07/1910Z remains in progress (currently ranging from 50 - 100
pfu). The maximum so far was 495 pfu at 08/0115Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels. The most disturbed levels followed a
prolonged period of southward Bz between 11/03 - 07Z. Solar wind
speed was elevated between 550 and 650 km/s. A 12 nT sudden impulse
was observed at the geomagnetic field at 11/1714Z. Solar wind plasma
and magnetic field measurements at ACE indicate weak transient flow,
likely from the CME activity on 09 - 10 November.
