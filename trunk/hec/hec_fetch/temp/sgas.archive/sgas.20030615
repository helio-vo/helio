B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
active to major storm levels.  The onset of the expected coronal
hole was marked by a co-rotating interacting region with solar wind
speed increasing to near 600 km/s and a 12 hour period of minor
storm levels.  Late in the period indications of a possible shock
passage at the NASA/ACE spacecraft coincided with a major storm
period.
