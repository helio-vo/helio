Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 351 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Dec 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been
quiet.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels
during part of the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM FRIDAY
STRONG STRATOSPHERIC WARMING IN PROGRESS.  THE VORTEX CENTER SHIFTED
TOWARDS CANADA; THE VORTEX BEING ELONGATED TOWARDS THE BARENTS SEA
AND KASACHSTAN.  AN ANTICYCLONE OVER THE PACIFIC; A NEW ANTICYCLONE
DEVELOPING OVER THE NORTH ATLANTIC.  COLD AIR BEING DISPLACED TO
NORTHERN CANADA; WARM AIR CENTERED OVER CENTRAL ASIA.
