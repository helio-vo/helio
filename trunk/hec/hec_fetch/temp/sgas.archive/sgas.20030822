Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 234 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Aug 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Aug

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to severe storm levels. The most disturbed period was from
21/0600 to 0900 UTC. ACE solar wind data indicates the gradual onset
of a coronal hole high-speed-stream over the past 24 hours. Current
solar wind parameters include speed at about 700 km/s, density from
1 to 5 p/cc, and Bz fluctuating between +/- 10 nT.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
