Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 103 Issued at 0245Z on 12 Apr 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 11 Apr

B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event began at
11/1135Z. The peak so far has been 35 pfu at 11/1845Z. The event was
in decline by the end of the period. This proton event is likely
associated with the C9 flare at 11/0419Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. Solar wind speed began the period at elevated levels
(over 500 km/s) following yesterday's CME arrival at 10/1925Z.
However, IMF Bz stayed predominantly northward and as a result, the
geomagnetic disturbance was weak.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
