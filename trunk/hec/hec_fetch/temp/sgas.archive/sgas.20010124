Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 024 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Jan 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  The 10 MeV protons remained slightly enhanced but
well below event threshold.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  An interplanetary shock was observed at the ACE spacecraft
at 23/1008Z and was followed by a sudden impulse at Earth at
23/1047Z.  The geomagnetic field was unsettled to active the rest of
the period.
