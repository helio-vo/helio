Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 079 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Mar 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Mar

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm conditions.   An interplanetary shock passed
the ACE spacecraft around 19/1020 UTC.  This activity is likely
associated with the CME which occurred late on 15 March.  A brief
magnetopause crossing was observed on GOES-8 (W075) at 19/1807 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists stratwarm Monday.
Slowly increasing temperatures over the polar
region and weakening of the cyclonic circulation.
End of this alert period.
