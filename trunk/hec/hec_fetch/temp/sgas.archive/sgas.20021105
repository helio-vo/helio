Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 309 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Nov 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to active levels.  The Bz component of the interplanetary
magnetic field was mostly southward and the solar wind speed was
elevated throughout the period in response to a geoeffective high
speed coronal hole stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 177  SSN 166  Afr/Ap 018/021   X-ray Background B8.3
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.3e+06   GT 10 MeV 3.5e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
