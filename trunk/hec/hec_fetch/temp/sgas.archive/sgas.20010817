Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 229 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Aug 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  A major proton event for >= 100MeV protons above
1pfu began at 16/0105 UTC, followed by >= 10Mev protons above 10pfu
at 16/0135 UTC.  Maximum flux for 100Mev protons was 29pfu at
16/0305 UTC, and for 10MeV protons was 493pfu at 16/0355 UTC.  Both
events remain in progress.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity has
been quiet to unsettled throughout the period.  Greater than 2MeV
electrons were observed at moderate enhancement levels again today,
although the electron sensor on GOES-8 was saturated by the proton
event for much of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
