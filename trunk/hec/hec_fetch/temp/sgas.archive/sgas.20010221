Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 052 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Feb 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm Alert Exists Tuesday
Major warming continues. A large warm area covers the polar region,
Siberia, Europe, and the eastern Atlantic, leading to a reversed
temperature gradient between 60N and the pole up to 5 HPA. Displaced
vortex lead to net easterly winds at latitude 60N throughout the
stratosphere.
