Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 003 Issued at 0245Z on 03 Jan 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 02 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels. High speed coronal hole flow,
possibly combined with weak transient flow from the late December
CME activity, is responsible for this disturbance. Solar wind speed
increased to over 800 km/s by the middle of the period and ranged
from 700 - 850  km/s for the remainder of the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
