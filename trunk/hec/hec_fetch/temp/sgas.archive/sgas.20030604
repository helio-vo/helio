B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
unsettled to active. There was an isolated minor storm period from
0900-1200 UTC. Solar wind data continue to indicate the presence of
a high-speed wind stream, which is due to a favorably positioned
coronal hole.  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes reached high
levels during the past 24 hours.
