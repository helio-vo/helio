B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
unsettled to active with isolated minor storm periods during local
nighttime hours. Solar wind speed began a gradual rise from near 500
km/s midway through the period to approximately 650 km/s by the end
of the period.
