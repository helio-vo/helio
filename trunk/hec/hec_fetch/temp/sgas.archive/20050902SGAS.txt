Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 245 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Sep 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels.  Minor to major storm periods occurred
between 31/2100 to 01/0600 UTC in response to the corotating
interaction region that became geoeffective after 31/1000 UTC.
