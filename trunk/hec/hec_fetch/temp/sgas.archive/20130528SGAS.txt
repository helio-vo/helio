B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Quiet to active.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 110  SSN 087  Afr/Ap 008/012   X-ray Background B3.1
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 2.3e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.7e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.60e+09 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-15 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 2 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 Planetary 2 3 1 3 3 2 4 3 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit reached very high levels during the summary
period. Particle measurements are being reported from the GOES-15
satellite due to a GOES-13 outage.
