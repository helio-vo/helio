Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 222 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Aug 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Aug
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Active periods occurred in association with a
rising trend in solar wind speed and sustained periods of southward
Bz throughout the latter part of the day.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
