Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 332 Issued at 0245Z on 28 Nov 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 27 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  The solar wind speed has steadily decreased to
less than 550 km/sec during the period as the coronal hole moves out
of geoeffective position.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
