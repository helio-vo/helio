Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 007 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Jan 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet
with isolated unsettled conditions late in the period. Solar wind
speed remains elevated; however, IMF Bz was sustained northward for
most of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 083  SSN 014  Afr/Ap 002/004   X-ray Background A4.7
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 2.3e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W106 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 9.10e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 Planetary 2 0 0 0 0 1 3 1 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was at high levels again today.
