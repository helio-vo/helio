Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 270 Issued at 0245Z on 27 Sep 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 Sep
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  A coronal hole, which has induced
a high-speed solar wind stream for the last few days, is in its
final stages, but continues to impact the Earth's magnetic field.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
