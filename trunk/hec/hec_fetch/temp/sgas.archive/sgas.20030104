Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 004 Issued at 0245Z on 04 Jan 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 03 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly quiet to unsettled.  Isolated active to minor storm
conditions were observed between 03/1500 to 1800 UTC due to the
effects of a favorably positioned coronal hole.  The greater than 2
MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels during
the past 24 hours.
D.  Stratwarm:  ALERT: STRATWARM
VALID FOR UTC DAY: 2003 JAN 03
UPPER STRATOSPHERIC WARMING, CENTERED WITH PLUS 29C AT 2HPA OVER
65N/0E, CONTINUES, SLOWLY WEAKENING; TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN
69N AND THE POLE STILL REVERSED BETWEEN 10 AND 1HPA.
