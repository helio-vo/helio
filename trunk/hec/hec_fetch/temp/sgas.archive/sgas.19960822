Dear SEC Customer,

SEC experienced a major problem with its main data base late on August
16. The data base was not restarted until August 19. During that time,
the Outside User Systems (OUS) products could not update. Products 
issued since the data base recovered are being updated. 
 
The products missed between August 16-19 are still not available but
should be restored over the next several days. These products will not 
be automatically emailed to majordomo customers. If you cannot access 
the missed products through the OUS Gopher or FTP please let us know 
and we will email them to you.

We are sorry for the inconvenience this caused many of our customers. 

If we can be of further assistance please call.

Sincerely,


Viola Raben
