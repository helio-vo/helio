Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 264 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Sep 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Sep
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event followed
today's M1 flare at 19/1712Z. The proton event began at 19/1925Z and
was still in progress at the time of issue. The maximum flux value
so far is 47 pfu at 19/2335Z. A greater than 100 MeV proton flux
enhancement was also observed, but has not exceeded the 1 pfu event
threshold.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. Solar wind speed was generally below 400 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
