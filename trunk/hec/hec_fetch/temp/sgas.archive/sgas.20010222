Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 053 Issued at 0245Z on 22 Feb 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 21 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1411 1427 1440  9354 S08W29 C6.2  Sf 2400                          
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.  A non-Earth directed CME occurred yesterday behind the
NE limb.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/WEDNESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
MAJOR WARMING CONTINUES.
A LARGE WARM AREA COVERS THE POLAR REGION,
SIBERIA EUROPE AND THE EASTERN ATLANTIC,
LEADING TO A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT
BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE UP TO 10 HPA.
A POLAR ANTICYCLONE AND A SPLIT, SOUTHWARD
DISPLACED VORTEX LEAD TO NET EASTERLY WINDS
AT LATITUDE 60N THROUGHOUT THE STRATOSPHERE.
