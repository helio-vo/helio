Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 160 Issued at 0245Z on 09 Jun 2015
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 08 Jun

B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to major storm levels during the period under the
influence of a CIR followed by a CH HSS.  An isolated major storm
period was observed during the 08/0600-0900Z period as the Bz
component deflected southward for close to an hour with a maximum of
-21 nT.
