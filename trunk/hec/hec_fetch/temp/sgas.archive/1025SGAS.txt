Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 298 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Oct 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  Solar wind speed dropped down to approximately
400 km/s as the coronal hole moves out of geoeffective position.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
