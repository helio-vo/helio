B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels during the past 24 hours. The
interplanetary magnetic field component Bz went through an interval
between 06/1800-07/0400 UTC with weakly but persistently negative
values ranging from 0 nT to -7 nT. This resulted in unsettled to
active levels between 06/2100-07/0300 UTC followed by a minor storm
interval from 0300-0600 UTC and another active period from 0600-0900
UTC. Conditions have been at quiet to unsettled levels since 0900
UTC.
