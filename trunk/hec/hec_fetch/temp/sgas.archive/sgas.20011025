Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 298 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Oct 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Oct

B.  Proton Events:  Greater than 10 MeV protons were elevated but
continued slow decay.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic activity was at quiet
levels.  The shock arrival from the two CMEs (M6/2N on 22/1502 UTC
and X1/2B on 22/1759 UTC)) appears to have lower shock velocity than
expected.  The early signs of a shock signature are visible on NASA
ACE/EPAM data.
