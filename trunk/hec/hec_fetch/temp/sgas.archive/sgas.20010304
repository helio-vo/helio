Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 063 Issued at 0245Z on 04 Mar 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 03 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0105 0108 0111              B5.6     330                           
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
minor storm.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists.
As a result of the major warming, the circulation
in the lower stratosphere remains disturbed, but
in the upper and middle stratosphere, a
re-established cold polar vortex exists.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
