Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 026 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Jan 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1842 1855 1911  0268 N13W26 C4.4  Sf 89     190                    
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  Minor storm levels were reached
due to an elevated solar wind speed near 800 km/s combined with a
seven hour period of negative Bz.  Solar wind speed was in gradual
decay at the end of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/SATURDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS
DISTURBED WAVE NUMBER TWO CIRCULATION PATTERN AND TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION WITH A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND
THE POLE FROM 5 HPA UPWARDS.
