JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 161 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 09 JUN 2000
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 08 JUN
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV PROTON FLUX AT
GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT REMAINED ABOVE THRESHOLD VALUES THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD.  FLUX PEAKED AT 84 PFU'S AT 08/0940Z, AND DECREASED TO ABOUT
14 PFU BY END PERIOD.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS AT
UNSETTLED TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS.  A SUDDEN IMPULSE OCCURRED AT
08/0909Z (77 NT, AS MEASURED BY THE BOULDER USGS MAGNETOMETER) AS A
RESULT OF SHOCK ARRIVAL MEASUED AT THE ACE SPACECRAFT, WHERE SOLAR
WIND VELOCITY JUMPED FROM 520 TO OVER 800 KM/S AT 08/0841Z AND BZ
DROPPED TO ABOUT -20NT.  MINOR TO SEVERE STORM LEVELS WERE OBSERVED
FOLLOWING THE SHOCK ARRIVAL.  THIS SHOCK IS PRESUMED TO BE RELATED
TO THE X2/3B EVENT ON 06 JUNE.
