B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
SOLAR WIND PARAMETERS WERE VARIABLE (TOTAL FIELD AND DENSITY
INCREASES AND PERIODS OF BZ SOUTHWARD) AT THE END OF THE PERIOD BUT
HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE FIELD.
D.  STRATWARM:  STRATWARM ALERT/SATURDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
MAJOR WARMING EXISTS.
THE STRONG ANTICYCLONE OVER CANADIAN ARCTIC CONTINUES. THE
INTENSE WARMING OVER POLAR REGION SLIGHTLY WEAKENING.
THE MAIN VORTEX DISPLACED OVER SOUTHERN URAL AREA AND THE
SECOND WEAKER VORTEX EXISTS OVER LABRADOR, TODAY.
MEAN ZONAL WIND AT 60 N IS FROM EAST ( 15 M/S ) AT 10 HPA
AND ABOVE IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE AND TEMPERATURE GRADIENT
REVERSED BETWEEN 60 N AND THE POLE IN THE WHOLE STRATOSPHERE
BELOW 2 HPA.
