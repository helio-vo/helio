B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to severe storm levels.  Major storm periods at middle
latitudes with severe storm periods at higher latitudes were
observed between 05/0000 UTC and 05/0600 UTC.  At approximately 0200
UTC on 05 April, solar wind speed at ACE increased from 560 km/s to
650 km/s while temperature, density, and the IMF decreased.  In
addition, Bz remained southward for several hours following this
sudden change.
