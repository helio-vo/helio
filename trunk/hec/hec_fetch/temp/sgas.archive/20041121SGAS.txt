Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 326 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Nov 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  Active periods were due to the effects of sustained periods
of southward Bz.  Solar wind speed at ACE showed an increase from
450 km/s to 550 km/s at approximately 1600 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
