Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 141 Issued at 0245Z on 21 May 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 May

B.  Proton Events:  No proton events occurred. However, a greater
than 10 MeV proton flux enhancement followed the M6 X-ray flare
above.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Quiet to unsettled conditions
prevailed.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
