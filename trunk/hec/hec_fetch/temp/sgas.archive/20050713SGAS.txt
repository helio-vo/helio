B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels.  A discontinuity in the solar wind
plasma parameters at around 12/0400Z was likely the arrival of
transient flow from the 9 July CME. Solar wind speed increased from
400 km/s to near 550 km/s. The IMF Bz was southward for extended
periods of time before rotating northward at around 1600Z. Minor to
major storming was observed at high latitudes between 12/0000 -
1800Z.
