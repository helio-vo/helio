B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Quiet to active.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT / SATURDAY / STRATWARM EXISTS.
THE WAVE TWO FORMATION IS STILL EVIDENT BUT WEAKENING.  THERE IS A
REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 50 AND 10 HPA AS WELL AS AT 1
HPA.  THE WINDS AT 60N HAVE RETURNED TO WESTERLY AT ALL LEVELS.  THE
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT IS FORECAST TO GRADUALLY RETURN TO NORMAL.  END
OF THIS ALERT PERIOD.
