Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 167 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Jun 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 2325 2356 0025  0386 S07E80 X1.3  Sf 2000   860    II/IV           
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  The geomagnetic field has been
disturbed by a combination of high speed flow effects and weak
shocks that were observed yesterday and today.  Greater than 2 MeV
electron fluence was at background levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
