Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 349 Issued at 0245Z on 14 Dec 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 Dec

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet,
with an isolated unsettled period during 0000-0300 UTC observed at
Boulder.  The greater-than-2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous
orbit was at moderate levels (above 1000 pfu) during local dawn and
daytime hours.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/WEDNESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
MAJOR WARMING IN PROGRESS.  THE VORTEX CENTRE DISPLACED TO 
CANADA AND MOVING DUE WEST COINCIDENT WITH THE COLDEST AIR.  
THE WARM AIR TRAVELS TOWARDS THE BARENTS SEA AND AN
ANTICYCLONE DEVELOPS OVER NORTHERN EUROPE.
