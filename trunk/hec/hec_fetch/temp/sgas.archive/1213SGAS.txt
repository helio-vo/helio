B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event ended at
12/1040 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active with isolated minor storm periods. Activity was
due to enhanced solar wind speeds coupled with prolonged periods of
southward Bz.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
