Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 070 Issued at 0245Z on 11 Mar 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 10 Mar

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Quiet to unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists Saturday.
As a result of the major warming, the circulation in the lower and
middle stratosphere remains disturbed. Still, a reversed temperature
gradient remains between 60N and the pole in the lower and middle
stratosphere.
