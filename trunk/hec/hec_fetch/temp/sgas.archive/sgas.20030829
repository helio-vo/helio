B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
active to minor storm levels.  Portions of the high speed stream
from a departing coronal hole remain, keeping the solar wind speeds
above 420 km/s.  The interplanetary magnetic field continues to be
oriented southward.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
