Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been
quiet to minor storm, with severe storm conditions at high
latitudes.  An interplanetary shock passed the ACE spacecraft at
18/0005 UTC; subsequently the Boulder magnetometer registered a 50
nT sudden impulse at 18/0048 UTC.  This shock was likely associated
with the X14/2B on 15 April.  Greater than 10 MeV and greater than
100 MeV proton events began at 18/0315 UTC and 18/0255 UTC
respectively, most likely associated with the activity from old
Region 9415 behind the west limb.  The greater than 10 MeV protons
reached a peak of 321 pfu at 18/1045 UTC, while the greater than 100
MeV reached 12 pfu at 18/0600 UTC. The Thule neutron monitor
measured a ground level event between 18/0242 UTC and 18/0914 UTC;
polar cap absorption (PCA) event began at 18/0425 UTC and remains in
progress.  Values for the greater than 2 MeV electrons at
geosynchronous orbit were not reported due to sensor contamination
by the proton event.
