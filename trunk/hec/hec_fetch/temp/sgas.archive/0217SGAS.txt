Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 048 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Feb 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active conditions during the first half of
the period. Solar wind speed was elevated to near 600 km/s, but
declined to near 450 km/s by the end of the period.
