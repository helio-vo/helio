Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 316 Issued at 0245Z on 11 Nov 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 10 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  Event level proton fluxes continued today at the
greater than 10 MeV and 100 MeV levels.  Flux levels declined
throughout the period, with 100 MeV currently just above event
threshold at 1.3 pfu, and the 10 MeV currently (as of 11/0100Z) at
279 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels.  The field was initially running at
unsettled to active, but a strong interplanetary shock passed the
ACE spacecraft at 10/0604Z and was followed promptly by a sudden
impulse at 10/0629Z (measuring 67 nT in Boulder), and a period of
minor to major storm level activity.  This shock most likely is the
result of the CME associated with the M7 flare of 8 November, and
the solar wind signatures are consistent with an interpretation that
the Earth received a glancing, rather than a direct blow from the
interplanetary disturbance.  The geomagnetic field returned to quiet
to unsettled conditions at the end of the period.
