Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 131 Issued at 0245Z on 11 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 10 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
active to major storm levels from yesterday through 10/1600 UTC. 
Since then conditions have been predominately unsettled.  The high
speed solar wind continues, but has lessened from the 750-900 km/s
of yesterday to a steady 620 km/s.  The greater than 2 MeV electron
fluxes continue to be at high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 093  SSN 022  Afr/Ap 031/043   X-ray Background B1.1
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 2.2e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-10 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
