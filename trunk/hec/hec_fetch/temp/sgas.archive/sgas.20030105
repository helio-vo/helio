Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 005 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Jan 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Jan
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  A favorably positioned coronal hole was
responsible for the elevated conditions.  The greater than 2 MeV
electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached moderate levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/SATURDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS
UPPER STRATOSPHERIC WARMING, CENTERED WITH
PLUS 42C AT 1HPA OVER 70N/0E, CONTINUES;
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE
POLE STILL REVERSED BETWEEN 10 AND 1HPA.
