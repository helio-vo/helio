B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly at quiet to unsettled levels.  Brief active conditions
were observed at both the middle and high latitudes in the
20/1200-1500 UTC period.  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux at
geosynchronous orbit passed the 10 pfu threshold at 19/2225 UTC,
reached a maximum of 11 pfu at 19/2235 UTC.  The short lived 10 MeV
proton event ended at 19/2255 UTC though flux levels remained
elevated at time of bulletin issue.
