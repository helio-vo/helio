Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 114 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Apr 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active conditions late in the period. A
coronal hole high speed stream has rotated into a geoeffective
position. Solar wind speed gradually increased to near 600 km/s. The
IMF Bz was generally northward, but occasional brief southward
excursions occurred late in the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
