B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active with isolated, high latitude minor storm
periods. This disturbance is due to a high speed coronal hole
stream, with solar wind speed averaging 500 to 550 km/s over the
past 24 hours.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 Mev electron flux at geosynchronous
orbit reached high levels.
