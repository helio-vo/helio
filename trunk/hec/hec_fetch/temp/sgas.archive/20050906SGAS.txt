Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 249 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Sep 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0853 1041 1220              C2.7     600              IV           
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Solar wind was elevated, but declined from near 600 km/s to
approximately 450 km/s by the end of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.8e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.7e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W113 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 1.80e+09 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 4 2 3 4 2 3 3 2 Planetary 4 2 3 4 2 3 3 2 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was at very high levels today.
