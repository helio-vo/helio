Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 267 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Sep 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with a single occurrence of minor storming at 1500Z. 
Active levels were observed from 1500Z to 1800Z.  The minor storm
levels were attributed to a CME from an M-class flare on 19
September.  Solar wind speed increased to approximately 530 km/s
from 1850Z to 2045Z.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
