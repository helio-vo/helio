Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 018 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Jan 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. A coronal hole high speed stream is responsible for the weak
disturbed periods. The IMF Bz was predominantly northward which
offset the geomagnetic effects of the high speed flow.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
