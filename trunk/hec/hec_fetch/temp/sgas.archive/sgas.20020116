Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 016 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Jan 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  Particle flux for >10MeV protons reached event
level of 10 pfu at 15/1435 UTC, and the event remains in progress
with a current flux of about 12 pfu.  The slow enhancement in proton
flux is likely from a west limb CME on 14 January, with the delay in
proton enhancement due to the intervening effects of a coronal hole
high speed stream.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet. 
Particle fluxes for >2MeV electrons reached event level during the
period.  >2MeV electrons briefly exceeded 1000 pfu at geosynchronous
orbit near local noon, as measured on GOES-8, during 15/1405-1615
UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
