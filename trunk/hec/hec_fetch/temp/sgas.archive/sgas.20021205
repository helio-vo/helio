Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 339 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled, with an isolated active period observed at high latitudes
during 04/1500-1800 UTC.  High flux values for greater than 2 MeV
electrons at geosynchronous orbit were observed again for the sixth
consecutive day.
