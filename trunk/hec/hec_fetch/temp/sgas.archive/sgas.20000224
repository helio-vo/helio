JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 055 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 24 FEB 2000
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 23 FEB
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
 0550 0551 0551                       120

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  HE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS
PREDOMINANTLY QUIET TO UNSETTLED.  THE FIELD INCREASED TO ACTIVE
BETWEEN 15Z AND 18Z DUE TO THE ARRIVAL OF A CO-ROTATING INTERACTION
REGION (CIR) SEEN IN ACE DATA.  THIS CIR BROUGHT INCREASED SOLAR
WIND VELOCITIES AND MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH; BZ FLUCTUATED WILDLY
BETWEEN -15 AND 10 NT.  THE CIR HERALDS THE EXPECTED RETURN OF A
HIGH SPEED CORONAL HOLE STREAM.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE
E.  DAILY INDICES: (REAL-TIME PRELIMINARY/ESTIMATED VALUES)
