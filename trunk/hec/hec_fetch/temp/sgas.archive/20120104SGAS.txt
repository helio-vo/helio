Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 004 Issued at 0245Z on 04 Jan 2012
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 03 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels with an isolated active period from 03/0300 -
0600Z.  The activity was the result of sporadic polarity shifts
accompanied by a period of sustained southward Bz.
