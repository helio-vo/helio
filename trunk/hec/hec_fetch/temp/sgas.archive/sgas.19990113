JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 014 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 14 JAN 1999
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 13 JAN
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD BEGAN THE
PERIOD AT QUIET LEVELS.  SOLAR WIND DATA FROM THE ACE SPACECRAFT
SHOWED THE PASSAGE OF A SHOCK AT 13/0959 UT THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY
ENHANCED, SOUTHWARD INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELDS (-20 NT). THIS
RESULTED IN UNSETTLED TO MAJOR STORM CONDITIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF
THE DAY. THIS DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE ORIGINATED ON 9 JANUARY IN
ASSOCIATION WITH A FILAMENT DISAPPEARANCE IN THE NORTH CENTER OF THE
SUN AND/OR A LONG-DURATION C1 X-RAY EVENT. THE GREATER THAN 2 MEV
ELECTRON FLUX LEVELS AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT, WHICH ATTAINED HIGH
LEVELS ON 12 JANUARY, FELL BELOW EVENT THRESHOLD AT 12/1835 UT.
