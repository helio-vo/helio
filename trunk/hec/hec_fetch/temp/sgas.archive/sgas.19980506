B.  PROTON EVENTS:  THE GT 100 MEV FLUX BEGAN RISING AT 06/0825Z AND
REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 2.9 PFU AT 06/0840Z. FLUXES DECAYED SLOWLY
DURING THE DAY AND WERE NEAR BACKGROUND AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.
THE GT 10 MEV FLUX BEGAN TO RISE AT THE SAME TIME AND REACHED A
MAXIMUM OF 210 PFU AT 06/0945Z AND THEN BEGAN TO SLOWLY DECAY.
FLUXES WERE NEAR 10 PFU AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO
SLIGHTLY UNSETTLED.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE.
