Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 199 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Jul 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Jul

B.  Proton Events:  Greater than 10 MeV protons exceeded the 100 pfu
threshold at 17/1250 UTC, reached a peak value of 234 pfu at 17/1600
UTC and ended at 17/1710 UTC.  Greater than 10 MeV protons remain
above the 10 pfu threshold as of this forecast issue.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been
quiet to active.  A sudden impulse occurred at 17/1604 UTC and
measured 18 nT on the San Juan magnetometer.  Active conditions
followed the sudden commencement.   A PCA event began at 16/2215 UTC
and reached a peak absorption 4.8 Db on the Thule 30 MHz riometer. 
Greater than 2 MeV electron at geo-synchronous orbit reached
moderate levels.
