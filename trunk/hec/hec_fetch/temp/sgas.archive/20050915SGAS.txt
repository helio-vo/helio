Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 258 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Sep 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Sep

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux crossed the
10 pfu event threshold at 14/0040 UTC in response to an influx of
energetic particles from the recent X1 flares late on 13 September.
This new proton enhancement reached a maximum of 183 pfu at 14/1520
UTC before declining to around 35 pfu by 14/2140 UTC; it has since
increased to near 100 pfu by the end of the period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels. Minor storm conditions were the result of
elevated solar wind speeds and long periods of southward Bz in the
IMF.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
