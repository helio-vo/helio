Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 139 Issued at 0245Z on 19 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. Slightly enhanced solar wind conditions occurred late in
the period and produced the unsettled conditions.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 109  SSN 079  Afr/Ap 009/010   X-ray Background B1.7
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 6.0e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W93 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 3.10e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 Planetary 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 
F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electrons at geosynchronous
orbit reached very high levels today.
