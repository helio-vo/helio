Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 127 Issued at 0245Z on 07 May 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.  The elevated conditions are due a
favorably positioned recurrent coronal hole which became
geoeffective near 06/1530Z.
