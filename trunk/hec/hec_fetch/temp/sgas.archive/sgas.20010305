B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists.
As a result of the major warming, the circulation
in the lower stratosphere remains disturbed.  But,
in the upper and middle stratosphere, a re-
established cold polar vortex exists.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
