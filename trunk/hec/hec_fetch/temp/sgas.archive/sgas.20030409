Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 099 Issued at 0245Z on 09 Apr 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 08 Apr

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  A CME shock from the M1 event on 04 April arrived
early today with a 33 nT sudden impulse at 08/0115Z recorded on the
Boulder magnetometer.  Bz reached values near minus 10 nT and solar
wind velocity reached peak values near 500 km/s.  Unsettled to
active levels were observed at mid latitudes and an isolated minor
storm condition on the planetary index.
D.  Stratwarm:  None

F.  Comments:  Beginning 1500 UTC April 8, SEC will begin using data
from the GOES 12 satellite, and stop receiving GOES 8 data. GOES 12
has the new Solar X-Ray Imager (SXI), which will acquire real-time,
operational images of the solar x-ray flux. With the switch from
GOES 8 to GOES 12, the primary/secondary designations will change.
GOES 12 will be the primary satellite for the SXI. All other data,
including magnetometer, XRS x-ray measurements, and energetic
particles, will have GOES 10 as their primary source, with GOES 12
as the secondary source where available. Please see
http://www.sec.noaa.gov/GOES.html for important information on this
changeover.
