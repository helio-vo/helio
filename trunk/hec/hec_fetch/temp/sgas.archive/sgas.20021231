Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 365 Issued at 0245Z on 31 Dec 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Active conditions were the result of a favorably
positioned coronal hole that is in it's waning stage.  The greater
than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels
today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/MONDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
VERY STRONG WARMING CONTINUES IN THE UPPER AND MIDDLE STRATOSPHERRE,
 EXTENDING FROM NORTHWESTERN
ASIA TO NORTHERN EUROPE AND GREENLAND. TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN
60N AND THE POLE REVERSED DOWN TO 10 HPA AND NET EASTERLY WINDS AT
60N AT 1 HPA.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 114  SSN 044  Afr/Ap 014/015   X-ray Background B1.5
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 8.0e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.3e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
