B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Solar wind speed was near 600 km/s early in the period,
which accounted for the active periods. Speed declined to near 450
km/s by the end of the period. The field responded to the declining
solar wind speed by returning to mostly quiet levels.
