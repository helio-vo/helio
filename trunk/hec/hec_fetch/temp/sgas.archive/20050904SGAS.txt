Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 247 Issued at 0245Z on 04 Sep 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 03 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels.  Geomagnetic storming occurred between
03/0000 - 0600 UTC after a period of sustained southward Bz.  Solar
wind speed showed a steady decline with initial values around 675
km/s to day-end values around 550 km/s.  The total interplanetary
magnetic field at ACE declined throughout the period, ending the day
at about 5 nT.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
