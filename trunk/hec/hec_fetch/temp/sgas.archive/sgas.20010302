Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 061 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Mar 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM THURSDAY
AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR WARMING, THE CIRCULATION IN
THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE REMAINS DISTURBED, BUT IN THE
UPPER STRATOSPHERE, A RE-ESTABLISHED COLD POLAR
VORTEX EXISTS.
