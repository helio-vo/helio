Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 357 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Dec 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Solar wind speed remains elevated, ranging 600 - 650 km/s
since late on 21 December. This high speed stream is associated with
a well positioned transequatorial coronal hole.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT / MONDAY / STRATWARM EXISTS.
INTENSE WARMING OVER SIBERIA / EUROPE CONTINUES IN THE UPPER
STRATOSPHERE WITH RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED CONDITIONS IN THE LOWER
STRATOSPHERE UP TO THE 10 HPA LEVEL.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 138  SSN 152  Afr/Ap 018/015   X-ray Background B3.8
