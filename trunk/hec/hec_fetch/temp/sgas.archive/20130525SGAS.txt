B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux which began
23/2330Z, reached a maximum
of 1660 pfu at 23/0650Z, fell below the
1000 pfu threshold at 23/1040Zand fell below 100 pfu at 24/0435Z,
ending the day at 13 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
