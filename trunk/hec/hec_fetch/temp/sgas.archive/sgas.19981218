B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET.
D.  STRATWARM:  STRATWARM ALERT/FRIDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
MAJOR WARMING EXISTS.
THE STRONG ANTICYCLONE OVER THE CANADIAN ARCTIC MOVES
NORTHWARDS. VERY INTENSE WARMING OVER THE POLAR REGION
CONTINUES. TODAY, THE WARM AIR COVERS THE EUROPEAN ARCTIC
TOO, THEREFORE THE COLD REGION IS DISPLACED SOUTH OF 50 N
OVER NORTH ATLANTIC AND EUROPE. THE MAIN VORTEX EXISTS
OVER SOUTHERN URAL AREA AND A WEAKER SECOND VORTEX
EXISTS OVER NEWFOUNDLAND.
MEAN ZONAL WIND AT 60N IS FROM EAST AT 10 HPA AND
ABOVE IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE AND TEMPERATURE GRADIENT
REVERSED BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE IN THE WHOLE STRATOSPHERE.
