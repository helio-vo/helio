B.  Proton Events:  A 100 MeV proton event commenced 14/2255Z,
reached a 2.3 pfu maximum at 15/0015Z and ended 15/0325Z.  The
greater than 10 MeV proton event that commenced 13/0310Z, reached a
698 pfu maximum at 13/0925Z and ended at 15/1620Z.  The greater than
2 MeV electrons reached high levels today.
