Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 088 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Mar 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Mar
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to active with isolated minor storm periods during local
nighttime hours. The most active conditions early in the period were
due to a waning high speed coronal hole stream. A weak transient
passed the ACE spacecraft between 28/1400 - 1500Z. Predominantly
southward Bz in the IMF resulted in active levels late in the
period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
