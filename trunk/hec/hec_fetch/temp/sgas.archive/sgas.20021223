B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels with an isolated active period at middle and
high latitudes between 22/1800 and 2100 UTC.  The NASA/ACE
instrument detected a weak shock passage at approximately 22/1300
UTC.  The Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field has been
predominantly north since transient onset.  The greater than 2 MeV
electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached moderate levels today.
