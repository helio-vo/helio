B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet to minor storm levels.  Solar wind speed decreased to about
400 km/s.  After 13/1700Z, solar wind speeds increased to about 450
km/s and total interplanetary magnetic field at L1 showed steady
increase.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
