Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 168 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Jun 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1152 1200 1204  0386 S12E83 M1.7  Sf                               
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  The source of the minor storm
conditions may be associated with the Boulder magnetometer scaling
problem (see comment in VII).  Solar wind speed was in gradual decay
from a peak near 600 km/s early in the day to a minimum of 450 km/s
by 1600UTC.  Wind speed then increased to 550 km/s by the end of the
day.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 123  SSN 091  Afr/Ap 038/032   X-ray Background B3.6
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.8e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.7e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W126 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 6.90e+06 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W76 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 5 5 3 5 4 4 3 6 Planetary 4 5 2 5 4 3 5 6 
F.  Comments:  On 16 June, it was determined that a scaling problem
exists with the H-trace on the Boulder magnetometer instrument. 
While this problem, and its fix are being investigated the primary
instrument for Boulder K-indices has been switched to the Boulder
USGS (via Domsat) magnetometer, effective 1500 UTC on 16 June.
