Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 056 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Feb 2015
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field reached
minor storm conditions during the 24/0300 and 24/0600 UTC synoptic
periods in response to the high speed solar wind stream.  The
remainder of the period saw a wane from active to quiet conditions.
