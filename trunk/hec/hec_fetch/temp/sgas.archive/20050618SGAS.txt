SGAS Number 169 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Jun 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Jun

B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 100 MeV proton event began at
16/2125Z following yesterday's M4 flare. The event ended at 17/0730Z
with a peak flux of 2.9 pfu at 16/2315Z. A greater than 10 MeV
proton event began at 16/2200Z, peaked at 17/0500Z at 44 pfu, and
ended at 17/1805Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. The most disturbed conditions occurred early in the period
during intervals of sustained southward Bz. The elevated solar wind
conditions are due to the combined effects of CME transient flow and
a high speed coronal hole stream.
