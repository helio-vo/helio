B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels during the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/MONDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
UPPER STRATOSPHERE WARMING CONTINUES, CENTERED WITH PLUS 7C AT 1 HPA
