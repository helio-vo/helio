SGAS Number 015 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Jan 2008
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels.
