Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 305 Issued at 0245Z on 01 Nov 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 31 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. The most disturbed conditions were associated with a period
of sustained southward IMF Bz that began at around 31/0900Z and
persisted through the remainder of the period.
