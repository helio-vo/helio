Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 290 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Oct 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels with an isolated period of minor storm conditions
at high latitudes between 16/1800-2100 UTC.  The Advanced
Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite hinted at the possibility of a
weak shock passage commencing shortly after 16/1600 UTC.
