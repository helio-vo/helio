Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 184 Issued at 0245Z on 02 Jul 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 01 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with occasional active periods.  This weak disturbance is
due to a high speed coronal hole stream.  The solar wind speed
remains elevated at over 500 km/s, but is in decline.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
