Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary

This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Nov

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 100 MeV proton event that
started on 04 November continued through out the period and flux
levels continued to climb, closing out the day at 116 pfu. The
greater than 10 MeV proton event also continued to escalate flux
levels, closing the period at 24,300 pfu. Both proton events
originated from the X1/3b flare from Region 9684, that occurred on
04/1620 UTC. Subsequent flares may have contributed to the continued
proton flux increase. A polar cap absorption event remains in
progress.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
