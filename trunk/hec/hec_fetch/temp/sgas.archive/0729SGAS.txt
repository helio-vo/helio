Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 210 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Jul 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to major storm conditions. Major storm periods were observed between
28/0000 to 0300 UTC and 28/0300 to 0600 UTC. Heightened activity was
due to the onset of a coronal hole high speed stream. Solar wind
speed at ACE increased early in the period from approximately 540
km/s to a maximum of 710 km/s around 28/0400 UTC. Wind speed has
been slowly declining and ended the summary period near 550 km/s.
