Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 331 Issued at 0245Z on 27 Nov 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  A favorably positioned coronal hole is
responsible for the elevated conditions.
