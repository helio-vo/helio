B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
predominantly quiet to unsettled, with one isolated active period
observed at Boulder during 07/1500-1800 UTC.  Coronal hole effects
appeared to wane throughout the day.  A 10 MeV proton event began at
07/1830 UTC and remains in progress.  Maximum flux observed thus far
was 22 pfu at 07/1955 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
