B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Quiet levels occurred during most
of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists Friday.
As a result of minor warming, the circulation in the lower and
middle stratosphere remains disturbed. Reversed temperature gradient
between 60N and the North Pole in the lower and middle stratosphere.
