B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
active to major storm level.  A recurrent high speed stream coronal
hole is responsible for the elevated levels.  The greater than 10
MeV proton fluxes have been just under event threshold levels for
the past several hours of this period.  The greater than 2 MeV
electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit reached moderate levels
today.
