Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 073 Issued at 0245Z on 14 Mar 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 13 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 1954 2010 2026              B5.1     100                           
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Two separate periods of isolated active
conditions were observed due to Bz fluctuations near -10 nT.  Solar
wind velocity remained relatively steady between 450 - 500 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
