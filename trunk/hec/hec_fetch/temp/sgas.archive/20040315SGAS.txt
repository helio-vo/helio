Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 075 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Mar 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Slightly elevated solar wind speed with periods of sustained
southward Bz produced the disturbed periods.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
