Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 213 Issued at 0245Z on 01 Aug 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 31 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly active to minor storm levels.  The recurrent high
speed coronal hole stream continues to be geoeffective.  The greater
than 2 MeV electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit reached high
levels again today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 102  SSN 065  Afr/Ap 033/032   X-ray Background B1.8
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 5.7e+06   GT 10 MeV 1.3e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W113 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
