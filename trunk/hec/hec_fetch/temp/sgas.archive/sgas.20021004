B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to major storm levels. A CME was observed to pass the ACE spacecraft
at around 02/2200Z. Though it was a relatively modest shock, several
extended periods of southward IMF Bz ensued, creating the minor to
major storm periods. The storm is assumed to be associated with the
CME activity observed early on 30 Sep.
