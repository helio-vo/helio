Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 302 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Oct 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active due to a geoeffective coronal hole high speed stream. Solar
wind speed at ACE increased from approximately 320 km/s to 530 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
