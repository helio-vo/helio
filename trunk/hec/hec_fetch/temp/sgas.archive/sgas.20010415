B.  Proton Events:  There were no proton events detected at
geosynchronous orbit. However, the greater than 10 MeV proton flux
continued at enhanced levels (due to recent major flare activity) as
it gradually declined toward background levels.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Activity was at unsettled to
active levels until 14/0900 UTC, then decreased to quiet to
unsettled levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
