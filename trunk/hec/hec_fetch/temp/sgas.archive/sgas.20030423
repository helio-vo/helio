Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 113 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Apr 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Apr

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active. A high speed solar wind stream that began early
on 21 April continues. Solar wind speeds exceeded 600 km/s early in
the period, but gradually declined to below 550 km/s by the end of
the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electrons at geosynchronous
orbit reached high levels again today.
