B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly unsettled to minor storm levels. This disturbance
began on 12 February following the onset of a high speed coronal
hole stream. Solar wind speeds this period generally ranged from 650
to 700 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  None

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was at high levels.
