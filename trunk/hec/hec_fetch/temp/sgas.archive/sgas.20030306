B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Mostly unsettled conditions prevailed early in the period in
response to a waning high speed coronal hole stream. Solar wind data
indicated another high speed stream onset at around 1300Z, preceded
by a weak co-rotating interaction region. Solar wind speed ranged
from 500 - 550 km/s for the latter half of the period and isolated
active periods were observed at all latitudes. The greater than 2
MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels.
