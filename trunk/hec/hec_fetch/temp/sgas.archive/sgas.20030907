Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 250 Issued at 0245Z on 07 Sep 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 06 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with very isolated active periods. A high speed coronal
hole stream that has been in effect over the past few days continues
to subside, declining to near 550 km/s by the end of the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
