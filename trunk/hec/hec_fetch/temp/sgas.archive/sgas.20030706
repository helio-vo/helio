Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 187 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Jul 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Jul
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
unsettled to active levels.  There is still a strong influence from
a favorably positioned coronal hole, keeping the solar wind speeds
elevated to around 750 km/s.
