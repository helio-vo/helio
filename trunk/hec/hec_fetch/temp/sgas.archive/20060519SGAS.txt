Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 139 Issued at 0245Z on 19 May 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels. Solar wind speed at ACE showed an increase
beginning around 18/0500 UTC as a coronal hole high speed stream
moved into geoeffective position. Solar wind speed increased to
around 600 km/s. An isolated minor storm period occurred between
18/1500 and 18/1800 UTC.
