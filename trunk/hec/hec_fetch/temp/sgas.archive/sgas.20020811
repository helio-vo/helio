B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels early in the day, then at quiet to
unsettled levels thereafter.  The isolated minor storm period was
observed at higher latitudes during 10/0300-0600 UTC, in probable
association with a sustained period of southward Bz during that
time.
