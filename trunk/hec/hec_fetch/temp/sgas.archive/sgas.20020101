B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 30/0245 UTC remains in progress and reached a maximum of 108 pfu
at 31/1620 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  An isolated active condition existed at
planetary, at 31/2400 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM MONDAY
WARM AIR COVERS MOST OF THE POLAR REGION IN THE UPPER AND MIDDLE
STRATOSPHERE.  THE TEMPERATURE GRADIENT ARE REVERSED DOWN TO 30 HPA,
ANDTHERE ARE MEAN ZONAL EASTERLY WINDS AT 10HPA AND ABOVE AT 60N. 
MAJOR WARMING CRITERIA FULFILLED.
