Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 085 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Mar 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled. An interplanetary shock was observed at ACE at 25/0058Z.
The field remained quiet to unsettled following this shock as Bz
remained northward for the duration of this weak transient passage.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
