Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 138 Issued at 0245Z on 18 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 May

C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet to unsettled levels.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at
geosynchronous orbit reached high levels today.

F.  Comments:  The GOES 10 energetic proton detectors are showing
intermittent, high noise levels in the higher energy proton channels
(greater than about 80 MeV). This problem was first noticed in data
taken April 26, 2003. To ensure continued operational monitoring of
important energetic particle data, it is necessary to reassign
primary/secondary designations for the GOES Space Environment
Monitor (SEM) detectors. As of 1500 UT on May 15, GOES-8 became the
primary satellite for protons. GOES 12 will be the primary satellite
for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements. GOES 10 will be
the secondary satellite for all SEM sensors - magnetometer, X-ray
sensor, and energetic particle sensor. This short-term solution
(approximately 2 - 3 months) will be in place until we define and
implement a permanent fix. A more detailed explanation can be found
