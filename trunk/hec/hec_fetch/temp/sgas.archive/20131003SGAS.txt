Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 276 Issued at 0245Z on 03 Oct 2013
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 02 Oct

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event at
geosynchronous orbit ended. The event began at 30/0505 UTC, reached
a peak flux of 182 pfu (S2 - Moderate) at 30/2005 UTC, and ended at
02/0510 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity ranged
from unsettled to major storm levels (G2 - Moderate) due to the
passage of the 29 Sep CME . Major storm levels occurred during the
02/0300 - 0600 UTC synoptic period.
