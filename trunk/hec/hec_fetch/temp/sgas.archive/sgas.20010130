Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 030 Issued at 0245Z on 30 Jan 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 29 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  A greater than 10 MeV proton event was in
progress at the start of the day, and reached a maximum of 49 pfu at
0655Z. The levels declined steadily after maximum and were hovering
around 10 pfu at the end of the day.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to minor storm levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists Monday
Strong major warming is in progress. The temperature gradient is
reversed in the upper stratosphere.
