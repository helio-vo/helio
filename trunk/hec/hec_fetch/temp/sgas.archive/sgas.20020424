Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 114 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Apr 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Apr

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 100 MeV proton event that began
at 21/0155 UTC ended at 22/2335 UTC (peak 22.9 pfu at 21/1025 UTC).
The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began at 21/0225 UTC
continued (peak 2520 pfu at 21/2320 UTC). The greater than 10 MeV
flux at the close of the period was around 120 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity ranged
from quiet to major storm levels. Field activity increased to active
to major storm levels during 23/0300 - 0900 UTC following a sudden
impulse at 23/0450 UTC (60 nT, as measured by the Boulder USGS
magnetometer). Activity decreased to unsettled to active levels
during 23/0900 - 1800 UTC. The field was quiet after 23/1800 UTC.
