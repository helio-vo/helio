B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity was at
quiet to active levels.  A sustained period of southward IMF,
following a weak interplanetary shock passage early on 28 February,
caused continued activity during 01/0000-0300 UTC.  Conditions have
waned to predominantly quiet levels since then.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM FRIDAY
Throughout the stratosphere, disturbed circulation pattern with the
warm air over the polar region and eastern Asia and a displaced
vortex over Siberia, leading to a reversed temperature gradient
between 60N and the pole from 100 to 2hpa and weak zonal easterly
winds at 60N in the upper stratosphere.
