Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 020 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Jan 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0415 0415 0415                       120                           
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  Active conditions commenced with an increase in
the solar wind speed to approximately 600 km/sec, believed to be
associated with coronal hole effects from the southern polar
extension whose leading edge is at about W53..
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/SUNDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
WARMING CONTINUES OVER THE POLAR REGION, BUT CONSIDERABLE WEAKENING.
REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE UP TO 2 HPA
AND EASTERLY WINDS AT 60N TO 1 HPA.
