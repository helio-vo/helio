Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 054 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Feb 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. Unsettled to active periods were due to the continued
influence of a coronal hole high speed stream. Solar wind speed at
ACE has decreased from approximately 700 km/s to 540 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
