Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 353 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Dec 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels with a period of minor storming between 17/0300Z
and 17/0600Z.  The active to minor storm levels were due to the
continued influence of a geoeffective coronal hole high speed
stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
