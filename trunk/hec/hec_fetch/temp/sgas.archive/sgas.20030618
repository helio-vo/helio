Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 169 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Jun 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 2144 2153 2158  0386 S07E55 C5.2  1f        140

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
active to major storm levels.  A six-hour period of southward Bz,
from 06 - 09 UTC combined with elevated solar wind speed near 510
km/s produced minor and major storm levels.  Greater than 2 MeV
fluence levels were at background levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 122  SSN 080  Afr/Ap 040/050   X-ray Background B2.8
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 7.9e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.8e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W127 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 8.00e+06 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W76 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 5 5 6 5 4 4 3 4 Planetary 5 6 6 6 4 4 4 4 
F.  Comments:  K-Indices:
On 16 June, it was determined that a scaling problem exists with the
H-trace on the Boulder magnetometer instrument.  While this problem,
and its fix are being investigated the primary instrument for
Boulder K-indices has been switched to the Boulder USGS (via Domsat)
 magnetometer, effective 1500 UTC on 16 June.  

GOES Protons:
To ensure continued operational monitoring of important energetic
particle data, it is necessary to reassign primary/secondary
designations for the GOES Space Environment Monitor (SEM) detectors.
Beginning 1700 UTC on June 18, GOES 11 (105W) will become the
primary satellite for protons. GOES 12 will continue as the primary
satellite for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements. GOES
10 (135W) will be the secondary satellite for all SEM sensors -
magnetometer, X-ray, and energetic particles.  Because of the
degraded state of the proton data on GOES-10, its designation as the
secondary source for proton data is a short-term solution.  More
permanent solutions have been identified and are being evaluated. 
Users will be notified when we define and schedule a permanent fix.
