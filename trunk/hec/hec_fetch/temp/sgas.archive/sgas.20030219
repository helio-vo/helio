Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 050 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Feb 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been at
quiet to minor storm levels.  A transient passage was observed at
the NASA/ACE spacecraft late on 17 February.  The transient resulted
in an increase in solar wind speed to over 700 km/s and combined
with fluctuating southward Bz was the source of minor storm
conditions measured at the Boulder magnetometer.  At about 18/0400
UTC, the solar wind became very structured and was marked by a
northward turning Bz and a gradual decline in solar wind speed to
current levels near 600 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/ TUESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
There is a strong wave two formation in the middle atmosphere with a
continuing reversed temperature gradient on all levels and easterly
zonal mean winds on 3 hpa and above.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
