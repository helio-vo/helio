Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 120 Issued at 0245Z on 30 Apr 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 29 Apr
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  Solar wind velocity remains elevated near
550 km/s.  Transient flow has produced periods of southward Bz that
resulted in isolated active and minor storm conditions.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
