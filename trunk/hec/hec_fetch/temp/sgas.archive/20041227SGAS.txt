Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 362 Issued at 0245Z on 27 Dec 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.  The solar wind speed is still elevated around 500 km/s
due to the continued influence of a geoeffective high speed coronal
hole stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
