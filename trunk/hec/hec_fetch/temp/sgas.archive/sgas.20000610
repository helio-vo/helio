SGAS NUMBER 162 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 10 JUN 2000
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 09 JUN
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  THE 10 MEV PROTON EVENT GENERATED FROM THE X2/3B
EVENT ON 06 JUNE ENDED AT 09/0325Z.
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO
ACTIVE.  THE 10 MEV PROTON EVENT GENERATED FROM THE X2/3B EVENT ON
06 JUNE ENDED AT 09/0325Z.  THE SOLAR WIND VELOCITY SLOWLY DECREASED
DURING THE PERIOD FROM 750 TO 550 KM/S.  WHILE MOST AVAILABLE DATA
INDICATED THE CHANCE FOR A STRONG GEOMAGNETIC STORM, THE BZ MEASURED
AT THE ACE SPACECRAFT STAYED NORTHWARD (POSITIVE) THE ENTIRE PERIOD,
NOT ALLOWING FOR A FAVORABLE MAJOR MAGNETIC STORM SITUATION TO
OCCUR.
