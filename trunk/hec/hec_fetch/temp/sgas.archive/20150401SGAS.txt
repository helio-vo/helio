Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 091 Issued at 0245Z on 01 Apr 2015
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 31 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  An 18 nT sudden
impulse was recorded by the
Boulder magnetometer at 31/0831 UTC as the
interplanetary shock
observed at the ACE spacecraft reached Earth.  The
subsequent
geomagnetic field response was muted.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
