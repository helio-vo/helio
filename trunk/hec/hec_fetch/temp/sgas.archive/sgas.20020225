Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 056 Issued at 0245Z on 25 Feb 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 Feb
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet with isolated unsettled periods.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM SUNDAY
STILL DISTURBED CIRCULATION AND TEMPERATURE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE
STRATOSPHERE WITH AN ANTICYCLONE OVER GREENLAND AND A DISPLACED
VORTEX OVER NORTHERN SIBERIA.  THE WARM AIR COVERS THE POLAR REGION
AND ASIA.  THIS LEADS TO A REVERSED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N
AND THE POLE FROM 10HPA UP TO 2HPA AND MEAN ZONAL EASTERLY WINDS AT
60N FROM 3HPA UP TO 1HPA.
