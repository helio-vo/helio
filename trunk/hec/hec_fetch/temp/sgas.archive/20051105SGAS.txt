Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 309 Issued at 0245Z on 05 Nov 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 04 Nov
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to minor storm levels.  A coronal hole high speed stream
is responsible for the elevated conditions.
