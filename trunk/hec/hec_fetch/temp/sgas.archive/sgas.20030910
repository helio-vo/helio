Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 253 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Sep 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The gemagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  The elevated conditions are due to a
recurrent coronal hole.
