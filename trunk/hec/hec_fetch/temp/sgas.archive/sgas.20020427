Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 117 Issued at 0245Z on 27 Apr 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 26 Apr

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 21/0225Z, and peaked on 21/2320Z at 2520 pfu, ended today at
26/0715Z. The 10 MeV proton flux remains elevated at near 5 pfu, but
continues to slowly decline.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet.
