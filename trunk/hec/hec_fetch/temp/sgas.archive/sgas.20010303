Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 062 Issued at 0245Z on 03 Mar 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 02 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with a single active period observed at Boulder.
D.  Stratwarm:  Stratwarm alert exists.
As a result of the major warming, the circulation
in the lower stratosphere remains disturbed, but
in the upper stratosphere, a re-established
cold polar vortex exists.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 130  SSN 077  Afr/Ap 006/008   X-ray Background B2.1
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 1.1e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.1e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
