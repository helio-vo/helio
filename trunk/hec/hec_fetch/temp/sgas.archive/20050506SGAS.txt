B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 109  SSN 050  Afr/Ap 005/006   X-ray Background B2.8
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 8.1e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.5e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W113 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence
GT 2 MeV 4.30e+08 e/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-12 satellite synchronous orbit W76 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:
Boulder 1 1 1 3 2 2 2 1 Planetary 1 1 1 3 1 2 2 1 
F.  Comments:  The Afr index reported in Part E is estimated from
Boulder observations. The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was moderate.
