Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 355 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Dec 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm conditions. Activity was due to a recurrent coronal
hole high speed stream. Solar wind speed at ACE has increased from
approximately 600 km/s to 740 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
