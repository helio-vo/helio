B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to unsettled levels.  Solar wind speed has continued to gradually
decrease, ending the period near 525 km/s. The greater than 2 MeV
electron flux at geo-synchronous orbit reached high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)

F.  Comments:  Daily X-Ray Background Flux value is estimated from
plotted data, pending repair of the automated algorithm.  Repair is
 in progress.
SSN is estimated based on SRS data.
