Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 121 Issued at 0245Z on 01 May 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was
unsettled to active with an isolated minor storm period between
30/0000 UTC and 0300 UTC.  Heightened activity was due to the onset
of a geoeffective coronal hole high speed stream.  Solar wind speed
at ACE increased from approximately 450 km/s to 600 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
