SGAS Number 114 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Apr 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was mostly
quiet to unsettled. An isolated active period was observed at
mid-latitudes between 23/0600 UTC and 0900 UTC. Solar wind speed at
ACE has decreased from approximately 600 km/s to 480 km/s.
