B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
predominantly quiet to unsettled levels.  An isolated active period
occurred at mid and high latitudes between 10/1200 and 1500Z.  The
greater than 2 MeV electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit reached
high levels today.
