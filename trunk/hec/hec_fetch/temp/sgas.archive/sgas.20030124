B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to minor storm levels.  The onset of coronal hole effects resulted
in minor storm conditions early in the period.  NASA/ACE instruments
indicate an increase in solar wind speed with peak values near 700
km/s.  The Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field was
slightly southward early in the period but has since been, on
average, neutral.  2 MeV electron flux at geo-synchronous orbit
exceeded event threshold today.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/THURSDSY/STRATWARM EXISTS

AT 1 HPA.
