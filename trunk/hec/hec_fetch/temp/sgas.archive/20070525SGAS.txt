Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 145 Issued at 0245Z on 25 May 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 24 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to major storming.  Extended periods of southward Bz
starting on 23 May, combined with rising solar wind speeds,
accounted for the most disturbed periods.  Solar wind speed
increased to approximately 650 km/s during the summary period due to
a recurrent coronal hole rotating into a geoeffective position.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
