B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton fluxes at
geosynchronous orbit which began at 28/1201Z and had two distinct
maximum measurements (29,000 pfu at 29/0615Z; from the X17 flare and
3,300 pfu at 30/1935Z; from the X10 flare) has ended at 01/1310Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels.  Solar wind speeds have gradually
decreased from the start of the period when they were approximately
800 km/s, currently down to 550 km/s (at the time of this writing)
while the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field has
remained predominantly northward during the period.
