Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 148 Issued at 0245Z on 28 May 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 27 May
A.  Energetic Events

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels. An SI was observed at the Boulder ground
magnetometer at 27/1456 UTC following a shock observed in the solar
wind at ACE at 27/1418 UTC. Timing of the structure seems consistent
with the M1/1N/Type II event which occurred on 24 May.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
