Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 082 Issued at 0245Z on 23 Mar 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 22 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to active conditions.  The solar wind speed has shown a
slow, yet steady decrease during the interval as a favorably
positioned coronal hole enters into its waning stage.  The greater
than 2 MeV electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit have again
exceeded high levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
