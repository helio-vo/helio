Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 200 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Jul 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Jul
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux that began on
14/0245Z, had a peak flux of 134 pfu at 15/0345Z, and ended at
18/1015Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has ranged
from quiet to major storm levels.  The elevated conditions may have
resulted from the X1 flare and associated full halo CME that
occurred on 14 July.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
