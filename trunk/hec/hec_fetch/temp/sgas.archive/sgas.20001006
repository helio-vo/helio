Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 280 Issued at 0245Z on 06 Oct 2000
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 05 Oct

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to severe storm levels (estimated Kp of 7).  A strong
shock was observed at the Ace spacecraft at 05/0241Z, and was
followed by transient flow with enhanced density, speed, and
magnetic fields.  Major to severe storming at all latitudes began
after 0300Z.  There were two intervals of strongly negative Bz:  the
first was from 05/0504 - 0543Z with Bz values reaching -27 nT, and
the second was from 05/0958 - 1119Z with Bz values reaching -23 nT. 
Severe levels were seen at high latitudes from 05/0300 - 1500Z, and
mid-latitudes also attained the K=7 level from 05/0600 - 0900Z.  The
disturbance appeared to be subsiding during the last hours of the
day to unsettled to active levels.
