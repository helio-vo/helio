JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 274 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 01 OCT 1998
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 30 SEP
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  THE GREATER THAN 100 MEV PROTON FLUX CROSSED THE
1 PFU THRESHOLD AT 30/1435Z AND REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 3 PFU DURING
THE PERIOD. THE GREATER THAN 10 MEV FLUX REACHED EVENT THRESHOLD OF
10 PFU AT 30/1520Z.  A MAXIMUM FLUX OF 1200 PFU WAS OBSERVED AT
