Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 283 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Oct 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
 0724 0741 0750  9657 N19E67 C7.0  Sf 125    12     II

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux at
geosynchronous orbit remained at elevated levels but below the
proton event threshold of 10 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels.  High speed stream effects are believed to be
responsible for the elevated field levels.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
