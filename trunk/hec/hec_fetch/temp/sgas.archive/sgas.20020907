B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux has been
slowly increasing over the past 24 hours, apparently due to a
backside solar event over the northwest limb. Current proton flux is
about 6 pfu.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
