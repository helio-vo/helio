Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 175 Issued at 0245Z on 24 Jun 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 23 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to major storm levels.  The storming conditions are
believed to be due to a Co-rotating Interaction Region, preceding
the onset of a recurrent high speed coronal hole stream.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
