Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 015 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Jan 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Jan

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active periods at higher latitudes. A period
(04-12Z) of mostly southward orientation in the IMF was responsible
for the more disturbed periods.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT/TUESDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
NEW WARM PULS, STRONGEST IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE, BUT TEMPERATURE
HAS INCREASED MORE THAN 30 KELVIN ALSO AT 10 HPA AND BELOW WITHIN
ONE WEEK OVER NORTHERN SIBERIA. REVERSAL OF THE TEMPERATURE GRADIENT
BETWEEN 60N AND THE NORTH POLE EXPECTED WITHIN THE NEXT 3 DAYS FROM
50H PA UP 1HPA.
