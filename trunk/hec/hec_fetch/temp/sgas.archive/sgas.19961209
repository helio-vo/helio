       -----  SEC Product HEADER Change Announcement -----


Dear Space Environment Center (SEC) customer:

SEC is converting its products and data listings to a more consistant 
header format. Samples of the old and new formats are shown below. 

In general, the changes add header and information lines with a unique
beginning character:
      o  A "#" in the first column indicates a header line
      o  A ":" n the first column indicates a key-word line. The key-word 
         between the colons is followed by some information
All products and listings will have two addtional lines: its name and
issue date. 

THERE ARE NO FORMAT CHANGES WITHIN THE PRODUCTS only to the header lines.


    !!!!!!!  The new formats will begin sometime after Dec 11th.  !!!!!!!

Products initially effected:
    Alert and Warning Messages
    RSGA - the "Forecast" - Report of Solar and Geophysical Activity
    SRS  - Solar Region Summary
    SGAS - Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
    SCDR - Solar Coronal Disturbance Report
    GEOA - GEOALERT
    WWV  - The Geophysical Alert Message
    Weekly Highlights and Forecast
    Weekly 27-day Outlook

SEC Services effected:
    Majodomo List Server
    World-wide web (only products in/from the Gopher/ftp directories)
    Gopher
    ftp

Update on other SEC changes: The new software to move us off the old 
database machine is scheduled to be installed beginning December 16th. 
While these changes will not effect the product format or contain, they may
cause disturbtions in service. Please bear with us during this transition.

We apologize for the inconvience these changes will cause our customers,
espically those who have developed software to decode our products. Again,
these are changes to the header line only, the product format do NOT change.
Our objectives are to:
       o standardize our products,
       o provide additional information with each product,
       o improve the reliabilities of our services,
       o establish format conventions for upcoming, new products.

Please send questions and comments to Viola Raben at vraben@sec.noaa.gov 
or (303) 497-5691.


Sincerely,

Viola Raben
Space Environment Center
