B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux increased
during the shock passage to 235 pfu before declining to around 10
pfu by the end of the period.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to severe storm levels. Geomagnetic storming occurred in response to
the arrival of a CME associated with the double peak X-flare on 13
September. A 29 nT sudden impulse was observed in the Boulder
magnetometer at 15/0907 UTC. Solar wind speed at ACE rose from
approximately 600 km/s to near 900 km/s. The most disturbed periods
occurred between 12 and 18 UTC following periods of southward Bz to
near -15 nT.
