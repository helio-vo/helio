Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 085 Issued at 0245Z on 26 Mar 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 25 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active with isolated minor storm periods at high latitudes. The most
disturbed geomagnetic conditions followed short periods of southward
IMF Bz to near -10 nT.  A high speed coronal hole stream rotated
into a geoeffective position over the past 24 hours. Solar wind
speed began the period at just over 400 km/s, but increased to near
700 km/s by the end of the period.
