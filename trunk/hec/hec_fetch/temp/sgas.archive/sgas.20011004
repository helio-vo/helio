B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
on 01 October continued. The peak flux for this event was 2360 pfu
at 02/1810 UTC. At the close of the period the greater than 10 MeV
flux was 30.7 pfu and gradually decreasing.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Field activity ranged from
unsettled to severe storm levels due to a CME passage. The severe
storm period occurred during 03/0900-1200 UTC. Major storm
conditions occurred during 03/0900 - 1800 UTC.
