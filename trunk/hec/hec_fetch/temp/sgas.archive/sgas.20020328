Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 087 Issued at 0245Z on 28 Mar 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 27 Mar
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated, high latitude active conditions early in
the period. The coronal hole, high speed stream which began early
yesterday has gradually decreased.
