B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that started
at 16/0210 UTC and reached maximum of 5040 PFU at 17/1750 UTC
continues in progress: there was a new injection of particles which
elevated flux levels to a secondary maximum of 1860 PFU at 20/0810 
UTC. A greater than 100 MeV proton event began at 20/0650 UTC, 
reached a maximum of 652 PFU at 0710 UTC, and continues in 
progress.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels.
