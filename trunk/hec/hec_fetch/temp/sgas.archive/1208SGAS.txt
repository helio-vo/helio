B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton event that began
at 06/1555Z continues. The maximum observed flux so far is 1980 pfu
at 07/1930Z.  The greater than 100 MeV proton flux crossed the 1 pfu
event threshold at 07/0115Z, with a maximum observed flux so far of
19 pfu at 07/1610Z.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field has been
unsettled to active with isolated minor storm periods observed at
high latitudes.
