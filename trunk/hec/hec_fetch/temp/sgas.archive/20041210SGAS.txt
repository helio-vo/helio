Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 345 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Dec 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with an isolated active period between 09/0900 - 1200Z.  A
sustained period of southward IMF Bz produced the active conditions.
Solar wind speed declined to near 400 km/s.
