Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 151 Issued at 0245Z on 31 May 2005
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to severe storm conditions. Heightened activity was due to
the resulting effects of a geoeffective coronal hole high speed
stream and CME activity from 26 May. Though the solar wind speed at
ACE was relatively low, Bz remained steadily south at approximately
15 nT for several hours.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
