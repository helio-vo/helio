Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 137 Issued at 0245Z on 17 May 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 May
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled level.  Solar wind velocity continues to decrease as the
previous coronal hole rotates across the west limb.  The greater
than 2 MeV electron flux was at high levels today.
D.  Stratwarm:  None.
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 103  SSN 097  Afr/Ap 009/009   X-ray Background B1.5
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)

F.  Comments:  The GOES 10 energetic proton detectors are showing
intermittent, high noise levels in the higher energy proton channels
(greater than about 80 MeV). This problem was first noticed in data
taken April 26, 2003. To ensure continued operational monitoring of
important energetic particle data, it is necessary to reassign
primary/secondary designations for the GOES Space Environment
Monitor (SEM) detectors. As of 1500 UT on May 15, GOES-8 became the
primary satellite for protons. GOES 12 will be the primary satellite
for magnetometer, X-ray, and electron measurements. GOES 10 will be
the secondary satellite for all SEM sensors - magnetometer, X-ray
sensor, and energetic particle sensor. This short-term solution
(approximately 2 - 3 months) will be in place until we define and
implement a permanent fix. A more detailed explanation can be found
