B.  Proton Events:  The 10 MeV integral proton flux at geosynchronous
orbit followed a slow rising trend shortly after the end of the east
limb X-flare of 28 December.  Flux exceeded event threshold at
29/0510 UTC.  Further enhancement in possible association with the
shock passage (described in Part C below) resulted in a peak flux
observation of 76 pfu at 29/0815 UTC.  The event ended at 29/2300
UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active.  An L1 shock passage was observed at approximately 29/0440
UTC, and followed by a sudden impulse of 44 nT at 29/0538 UTC. 
Predominantly northward IMF orientation following the shock passage
mostly mitigated the potential geomagnetic response to this event,
presumed to have originated from the CME activity of 26 December.
D.  Stratwarm:  STRATWARM ALERT EXISTS STRATWARM SATURDAY
WARM AIR COVERS MOST OF THE POLAR REGION IN THE UPPER AND MIDDLE
STRATOSPHERE, FURTHER PENETRATING DOWNWARDS.  THE TEMPERATURE
GRADIENT BETWEEN 60N AND THE POLE WILL BE REVERSED DOWN TO 50
HPA, AND MEAN ZONAL EASTERLY WINDS ARE EXPECTED BETWEEN 10
AND 2 HPA AT 60N.  MAJOR WARMING IN PROGRESS.
