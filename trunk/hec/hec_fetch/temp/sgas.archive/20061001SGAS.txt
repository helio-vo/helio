Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 274 Issued at 0245Z on 01 Oct 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 Sep
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to active levels during the period.  Active conditions are due
to the onset of a favorably positioned coronal hole.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
