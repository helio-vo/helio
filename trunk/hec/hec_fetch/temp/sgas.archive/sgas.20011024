B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV proton flux event at
geosynchronous orbit exceeded threshold at 22/1910 UTC, and reached
a maximum of 24 pfu at 22/2130 UTC.  The event ended at 23/0115 UTC.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels with an isolated period (23/0300 to 0600 UTC) of
minor storm conditions at USAF planetary.
