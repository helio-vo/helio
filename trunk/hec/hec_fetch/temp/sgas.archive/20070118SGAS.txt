Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 018 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Jan 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Jan
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm conditions. Activity was due to the
continued influence of a coronal hole high speed stream. Solar wind
speed at ACE has been elevated around 680 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
