B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 10 MeV event at geosynchronous
orbit that began at 25/1355Z in the wake of the Feb 25 X4/2b flare
continued, with a peak flux of 59 pfu (S1 - Minor) observed at
27/1845Z, in response to the arrival of a CME. The 100 MeV flux
enhancement at geosynchronous orbit (peak 0.9 pfu at 25/1945Z)
continued to decay toward background levels.
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  Geomagnetic field activity ranged
from quiet to major storm levels.
