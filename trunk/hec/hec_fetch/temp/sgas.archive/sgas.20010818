SGAS Number 230 Issued at 0245Z on 18 Aug 2001
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 17 Aug

B.  Proton Events:  The greater than 100 MeV proton event has ended
(start 16/0105 UTC, 29 pfu peak at 16/0305 UTC, and end 17/1415
UTC). The greater than 10 MeV proton event remains in progress
(start 16/0135 UTC, 493 pfu peak at 16/0355 UTC, and current flux of
17 pfu at 18/0000 UTC).
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels following a Sudden Impulse observed on
ground magnetometers (36 nT at Boulder) at 17/1103 UTC.
