Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 181 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Jun 2004
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Jun
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
unsettled with isolated active levels. Occasional periods of
southward Bz resulted in the active conditions. Solar wind
measurements indicated a transition into a weak coronal hole high
speed stream late in the period.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
