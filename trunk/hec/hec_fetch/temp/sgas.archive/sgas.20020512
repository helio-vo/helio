B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to major storm levels.  Data from the Advanced Composition Explorer
(ACE) showed an increase in the solar wind speed from roughly 350 to
450 km/s beginning at approximately 11/0915 UTC.  The north-south
component of the interplanetary magnetic field remained strongly
negative for several hours thereafter.  A sudden impulse of 41 nT
was observed at the Boulder Magnetometer at 11/1028 UTC.  Major
storm conditions were observed at high latitudes from 11/1100
through 11/1800 UTC.  Uncertain as to the source(s) of the activity,
although multiple CME's were seen in SOHO/LASCO imagery on the
eighth and ninth.  Source regions for CME's believed to have been
from both the east and west limbs.
