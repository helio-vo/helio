Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 202 Issued at 0245Z on 21 Jul 2003
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 20 Jul

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm levels. A high speed solar wind stream with
speeds exceeding 700 km/s is responsible for this disturbance.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
