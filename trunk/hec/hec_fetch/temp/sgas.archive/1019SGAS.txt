SGAS Number 292 Issued at 0245Z on 19 Oct 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 18 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 070  SSN 000  Afr/Ap 002/004   X-ray Background  LT A1.0
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 7.5e+05   GT 10 MeV 1.7e+04 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-11 satellite synchronous orbit W135 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence

F.  Comments:  The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit was at high levels again today. This daily
electron fluence enhancement has persisted at levels greater than
5.0E+08 for the past four days.
