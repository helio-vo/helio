Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 110 Issued at 0245Z on 20 Apr 2002
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 19 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
unsettled to major storm. A shock was observed at ACE at 19/0804 UTC
and was followed by an SI at ground magnetometers (36 nT at Boulder)
at 19/0836 UTC. This shock is believed to be associated with the LDE
M2/CME that occurred on 17 April.
D.  Stratwarm:  None
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
10 cm 180  SSN 182  Afr/Ap 035/044   X-ray Background B8.6
Daily Proton Fluence (flux accumulation over 24 hrs)
GT 1 MeV 5.4e+07   GT 10 MeV 1.9e+05 p/(cm2-ster-day)
(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
Daily Electron Fluence

(GOES-8 satellite synchronous orbit W75 degrees)
3 Hour K-indices:

F.  Comments:  The 19 April Afre reported in Part E is estimated from
Boulder observations.
