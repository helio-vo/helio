JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 355 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 21 DEC 1998
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 20 DEC
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
 0849 0900 0903  8415 N21E46 M1.8  1N        28                     
B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS
PREDOMINANTLY UNSETTLED. DURING THE PERIOD, SOLAR WIND VELOCITY
INCREASED, DENSITY DECREASED, AND SEVERAL INTERVALS OF PROLONGED
SOUTHWARD BZ WERE OBSERVED.
D.  STRATWARM:  STRATWARM ALERT/SUNDAY/STRATWARM EXISTS.
MAJOR WARMING EXISTS. THE MAIN ANTICYCLONE IS LOCATED OVER NORWEGIAN
SEA AND A SECOND ANTICYCLONE OVER ALASKA, TODAY. THE INTENSE WARMING
OVER SIBERIAN ARCTIC FURTHER SLIGHTLY WEAKENING. THE TWO CENTERS OF
THE VORTEX ARE OVER WESTERN SIBERIA AND OVER HUDSON BAY. MEAN ZONAL
WIND AT 60 N IS FURTHER FROM FAST AT 10 HPA AND ABOVE IN THE UPPER
STRATOSPHERE. TEMPERATURE GRADIENT REVERSED BETWEEN 60 N AND THE
POLE IN THE WHOLE STRATOSPHERE BELOW THE UPPERMOST LEVEL.
