JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY
SGAS NUMBER 243 ISSUED AT 0245Z ON 31 AUG 1999
THIS REPORT IS COMPILED FROM DATA RECEIVED AT SWO ON 30 AUG
A.  ENERGETIC EVENTS
BEGIN  MAX  END  RGN   LOC   XRAY  OP 245MHZ 10CM   SWEEP
 1103 1105 1105                       100

B.  PROTON EVENTS:  NONE
C.  GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY SUMMARY:  THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD WAS QUIET TO
UNSETTLED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 30/0800-1200Z INTERVAL. DURING
THAT TIME ACTIVE TO MINOR STORM CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED. THIS
DISTURBANCE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF A CORONAL
MASS EJECTION. RATHER, BZ TURNED SOUTHWARD PRIOR TO THAT TIME WHILE
OTHER SOLAR WIND PARAMETERS REMAINED UNREMARKABLE. ENERGETIC
ELECTRON FLUXES AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT REMAINED AT HIGH LEVELS.
D.  STRATWARM:  NONE
E.  DAILY INDICES: (REAL-TIME PRELIMINARY/ESTIMATED VALUES)
