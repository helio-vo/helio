Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 351 Issued at 0245Z on 17 Dec 2006
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 16 Dec
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active levels. The elevated conditions were due to the lingering
effects of the transient resulting from the X3 flare that occurred
on 13 December.  A shock passage was observed at the ACE spacecraft
at approximately 16/1722Z which was followed by a Sudden Impulse at
the Boulder magnetometer at 16/1756Z (13 nT).  This latest
disturbance is associated with the X1 flare that occurred on 14
December.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available

The greater than 2 MeV electron fluence at
geosynchronous orbit reached reached high 
levels today.
