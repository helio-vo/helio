Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 100 Issued at 0245Z on 10 Apr 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 09 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was quiet to
active. The magnetic structure of the solar wind appears to be
consistent with a co-rotating interaction region coupled with a
solar sector boundary crossing. Solar wind increased from around 350
km/s to 480 km/s by approximately 09/1700 UTC.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
