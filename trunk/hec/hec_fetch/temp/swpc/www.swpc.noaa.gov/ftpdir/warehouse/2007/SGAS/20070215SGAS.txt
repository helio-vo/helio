Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 046 Issued at 0245Z on 15 Feb 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 14 Feb
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at quiet
to active conditions. Activity was due to the continued influence of
a coronal hole high speed stream. Solar wind speed at ACE is
currently elevated around 660 km/s.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
