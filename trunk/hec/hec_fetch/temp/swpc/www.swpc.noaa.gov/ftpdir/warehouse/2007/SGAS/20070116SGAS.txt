Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 016 Issued at 0245Z on 16 Jan 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 15 Jan

B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field ranged from
quiet to major storm levels.  A recurrent coronal hole high speed
stream became geoeffective at approximately 15/0700Z.  Middle and
high latitudes experienced major storm conditions between 15/1200
and 1500Z.
