Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 304 Issued at 0245Z on 31 Oct 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 30 Oct
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field began the
day with a brief episode of minor storming but quickly subsided to
quiet to unsettled conditions as the influence of the coronal hole
high speed stream diminished.  The greater than 2 MeV electron flux
reached high levels again today.
D.  Stratwarm:  Not Available
E.  Daily Indices: (real-time preliminary/estimated values)
