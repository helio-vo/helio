Joint USAF/NOAA Solar and Geophysical Activity Summary
SGAS Number 119 Issued at 0245Z on 29 Apr 2007
This report is compiled from data received at SWO on 28 Apr
A.  Energetic Events
Begin  Max  End  Rgn   Loc   Xray  Op 245MHz 10cm   Sweep
None
B.  Proton Events:  None
C.  Geomagnetic Activity Summary:  The geomagnetic field was at
unsettled to minor storm conditions as a recurrent coronal hole high
